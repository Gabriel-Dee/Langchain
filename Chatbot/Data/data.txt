Suggested Meal Plan
This sample meal plan is one example of how to fit your nutrition needs (from the previous
page) into a day’s eating:
BREAKFAST

MORNING TEA

LUNCH

2 slices of toasted multigrain / wholemeal bread
1 cup of baked beans
200g low fat yoghurt
½ cup muesli
90 g tuna & salad on multi grain roll
1 medium piece fresh fruit

AFTERNOON TEA

1 slice of cheese on 3 crisp breads
1 cup raw vegetable sticks with hummus OR 2 tablespoons peanut butter

DINNER

SUPPER

65g cooked lean meat or 80g cooked chicken
1 ½ cups cooked mixed vegetables
1 medium potato OR 1 cup cooked rice/pasta
1 cup fresh
Myfruit salad

My
Nutrition
Nutrition
1 cup reduced fat milk

1 whole grain English muffin
Drink plenty of water during the day.

Iodine
Iodine is important for your baby’s growth and brain development. If you are pregnant or
breastfeeding, you should take a supplement with 150mcg (micrograms) of iodine.
You still need to consume foods that are high in iodine. These include fresh, cooked
seafood, bread with added iodine, eggs and dairy.
Do not take kelp (seaweed) supplements or kelp based products. These have varying
amounts of iodine and may have excess mercury.

Fluid
When you are breastfeeding, you need to drink more to replace the fluid used in breast
milk (~700 ml/day).
Achieve this by having a drink, such as water or reduced fat milk (within your dairy serve
recommendations) every time your baby feeds. You will also need to drink more fluid at
other times during the day.
Caffeine
Caffeine passes into your breast milk. Limit drinks high in caffeine to 2 to 4 each day.
High caffeine drinks include tea, coffee, cola, cocoa and drinks with added guarana
(energy drinks or guarana powder added to chocolate/milk drinks).
Alcohol
Avoid alcohol while breastfeeding, especially in the first month after you have your baby.
Alcohol passes quickly into your breast milk. After 30–60 minutes, your breast milk has the
same blood alcohol as you do.

My
My
Nutrition
Nutrition

If you do drink, limit the amount (1 standard drink/day) and have it just after feeding. Wait
2–3 hours before feeding again to allow a lower alcohol level in your breast milk by the
time of the next feed.
Avoiding foods during breastfeeding
Mothers may be told to avoid certain foods when breastfeeding. Severe allergic reactions
are rare in breast fed babies. Food intolerances can occur. If you are concerned what you
are eating is affecting your baby, contact your doctor or an Accredited Practicing Dietitian.
Managing constipation
•

Drink plenty of fluids

•

Eat high fibre foods such as wholemeal/ wholegrain breads and cereals, fruits, prunes,
vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds

•

Enjoy daily gentle exercise, such as walking

Trying to lose weight while breastfeeding
Breastfeeding can help you return to your pre-pregnancy weight, as your body uses fat as
fuel to make breastmilk. The greatest amount of weight loss generally occurs in the first 3
months after birth. It then continues at a slow and steady rate until 6 months after birth.
When you are trying to lose your pregnancy weight, it is important you still meet your
nutritional needs. Try these helpful hints:
•

Follow the meal plan in this handout (or similar).

•

Do not skip meals.

•

Limit foods high in fat and sugar. These include lollies, chocolate, soft drinks, cakes,
sweet biscuits, chips and take-away food.

•

Use healthy cooking methods like steaming, boiling, microwaving, grilling and stir
frying.

•

Trim fat from meats and avoid chicken skin.

•

Do some gentle exercise such as taking your baby for a walk. If available, attend
physiotherapy postnatal classes.

•

Plan your healthy meals and snacks ahead of time.

Are you losing weight too quickly?

My
My
Nutrition
Nutrition

If you are losing too much weight when you are breastfeeding it is important you do not
stop breastfeeding. Find ways to eat more nutritious foods.
Try these suggestions:
•

Don’t skip meals.

•

Have three main meals and three between-meal snacks.

•

Keep easy to prepare nutritious snacks handy (e.g. crisp-breads and cheese, fresh
fruit, yoghurt, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, canned beans, flavoured milk, fruit smoothies,
breakfast cereals and milk).

•

Prepare a packed lunch or variety of snacks to have beside you when breastfeeding.

•

Prepare and freeze meals in advance (or ask your friends / family to help).

•

Plan your healthy meals & snacks ahead of time.

How long should you breastfeed your baby?
Breastfeeding should provide all of your baby’s nutritional needs for the first 6 months of
life.
After you start introducing solids at around 6 months, it is recommended that you continue
breastfeeding for at least 12 months, into the second year of life and for as long as you
and your baby & are happy to continue.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 — Page iv

Message From the
Secretaries
We are pleased to present the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025. This edition marks the first time the
Guidelines provide recommendations by life stage, from birth through older adulthood.
Each stage of life is distinct and has unique needs that affect health and disease risk. Early food preferences influence
food and beverage choices later. And the science has evolved to focus on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern
over time. The science also shows it’s never too late to start and maintain a healthy dietary pattern, which can yield
health benefits in the short term and cumulatively over years. This new edition of the Dietary Guidelines includes
specific recommendations for all life stages, now including infants and toddlers, and pregnant and lactating women.
We are excited this is the first edition to provide guidance for every life stage.
This edition of the Dietary Guidelines is grounded in robust scientific reviews of the current body of evidence on key
nutrition and health topics for each life stage. We thank the 20 distinguished scientists on the 2020 Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee for their expertise and dedication in conducting an independent scientific review that was
characterized by more transparency and public participation throughout the process than ever before. The Committee’s
work culminated in a comprehensive scientific report on the current state of nutrition science and provided advice
to the Departments for our development of this 9th edition of the Dietary Guidelines. The Committee also included
important considerations for future research, such as a need to reconsider the Dietary Reference Intakes. The U.S. and
Canadian Dietary Reference Intake Steering Committees are currently developing plans to re-examine energy, protein,
fat, and carbohydrate–the timeline for these macronutrient reviews has not been established. USDA and HHS are
looking forward to jointly funding the work to help guide our Departments’ research agendas in the coming years.
With the science must come practice—that is, making food and beverage choices that align with the Dietary Guidelines.
Using the new edition of the Dietary Guidelines, we hope Americans can find ways to “Start Simple” and incorporate
modest changes each day that push Americans closer to meeting the recommendations. It’s more important than
ever to make healthy eating a priority in the United States. With the release of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,
2020-2025, we have an important call to action for you as health professionals and policymakers. We are asking you to
help the public “make every bite count with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.” Help people make food and beverage
choices that are rich in nutrition—individual choices that can become a healthy routine over time, choices they can
enjoy in good health for many years to come.
Thank you for all you do to help Americans make strides toward aligning closer to the Dietary Guidelines as we all work
together to help the public lead healthier lives.

Executive Summary
The foods and beverages that people consume have
a profound impact on their health. The scientific
connection between food and health has been well
documented for many decades, with substantial and
increasingly robust evidence showing that a healthy
lifestyle—including following a healthy dietary pattern—
can help people achieve and maintain good health
and reduce the risk of chronic diseases throughout
all stages of the lifespan: infancy and toddlerhood,
childhood and adolescence, adulthood, pregnancy and
lactation, and older adulthood. The core elements of
a healthy dietary pattern are remarkably consistent
across the lifespan and across health outcomes.

Research Act, which states that at least every 5 years,
the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and of
Health and Human Services (HHS) must jointly publish
a report containing nutritional and dietary information
and guidelines for the general public. The statute
(Public Law 101-445, 7 United States Code 5341 et
seq.) requires that the Dietary Guidelines be based on
the preponderance of current scientific and medical
knowledge. The 2020-2025 edition of the Dietary
Guidelines builds from the 2015 edition, with revisions
grounded in the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee and consideration of
Federal agency and public comments.

Since the first edition was published in 1980, the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans have provided science-based
advice on what to eat and drink to promote health,
reduce risk of chronic disease, and meet nutrient needs.
Publication of the Dietary Guidelines is required under
the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and Related

The Dietary Guidelines is designed for policymakers
and nutrition and health professionals to help all
individuals and their families consume a healthy,
nutritionally adequate diet. The information in
the Dietary Guidelines is used to develop, implement,
and evaluate Federal food, nutrition, and health policies

Page vii | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary

and programs. It also is the basis for Federal nutrition
education materials designed for the public and for
the nutrition education components of USDA and
HHS nutrition programs. State and local governments,
schools, the food industry, other businesses,
community groups, and media also use Dietary
Guidelines information to develop programs, policies,
and communication for the general public.
The aim of the Dietary Guidelines is to promote health
and prevent disease. Because of this public health
orientation, the Dietary Guidelines is not intended
to contain clinical guidelines for treating chronic
diseases. Chronic diseases result from a complex
mix of genetic, biological, behavioral, socioeconomic,
and environmental factors, and people with these
conditions have unique health care requirements that
require careful oversight by a health professional. The
body of scientific evidence on diet and health reviewed
to inform the Dietary Guidelines is representative of the
U.S. population—it includes people who are healthy,
people at risk for diet-related chronic conditions and
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2
diabetes, and obesity, and some people who are living
with one or more of these diet-related chronic illnesses.
At the same time, it is essential that Federal agencies,
medical organizations, and health professionals adapt
the Dietary Guidelines to meet the specific needs of
their patients as part of an individual, multifaceted
treatment plan for the specific chronic disease.

Consistent
and Evolving

The second is its focus on dietary patterns.
Researchers and public health experts, including
registered dietitians, understand that nutrients and
foods are not consumed in isolation. Rather, people
consume them in various combinations over time—a
dietary pattern—and these foods and beverages act
synergistically to affect health. The Dietary Guidelines
for Americans, 2015-2020 puts this understanding
into action by focusing its recommendations on
consuming a healthy dietary pattern. The 2020-2025
Dietary Guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the
importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole—
rather than on individual nutrients, foods, or food
groups in isolation.
The third is its focus on a lifespan approach. This
edition of the Dietary Guidelines highlights the
importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns at
every life stage from infancy through older adulthood. It
provides recommendations for healthy dietary patterns
by life stage, identifying needs specific to each life stage
and considering healthy dietary pattern characteristics
that should be carried forward into the next stage of
life. For the first time since the 1985 edition, the 20202025 Dietary Guidelines includes recommendations for
healthy dietary patterns for infants and toddlers.

The Guidelines

Although many recommendations have remained
relatively consistent over time, the Dietary Guidelines
also has built upon previous editions and evolved as
scientific knowledge has grown. The Dietary Guidelines
for Americans, 2020-2025 reflects this in three
important ways:
The first is its recognition that diet-related chronic
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2
diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer, are very
prevalent among Americans and pose a major public
health problem. Today, more than half of adults
have one or more diet-related chronic diseases. As a
result, recent editions of the Dietary Guidelines have
focused on healthy individuals, as well as those with
overweight or obesity and those who are at risk of

chronic disease. A fundamental premise of the 20202025 Dietary Guidelines is that just about everyone,
no matter their health status, can benefit from shifting
food and beverage choices to better support healthy
dietary patterns.

The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines provides four
overarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating
patterns at each stage of life and recognize that
individuals will need to make shifts in their food and
beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern. The
Guidelines also explicitly emphasize that a healthy
dietary pattern is not a rigid prescription. Rather, the
Guidelines are a customizable framework of core
elements within which individuals make tailored and
affordable choices that meet their personal, cultural,
and traditional preferences. Several examples of
healthy dietary patterns that translate and integrate
the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat
are provided. The Guidelines are supported by Key
Recommendations that provide further guidance on
healthy eating across the lifespan.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary | Page viii

The Guidelines

Make every bite count with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Here’s how:

1

Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage.

At every life stage—infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, pregnancy, lactation, and
older adulthood—it is never too early or too late to eat healthfully.
• For about the first 6 months of life, exclusively feed infants human milk. Continue to feed infants
human milk through at least the first year of life, and longer if desired. Feed infants iron-fortified infant
formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable. Provide infants with supplemental
vitamin D beginning soon after birth.
• At about 6 months, introduce infants to nutrient-dense complementary foods. Introduce infants to
potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods. Encourage infants and toddlers
to consume a variety of foods from all food groups. Include foods rich in iron and zinc, particularly for
infants fed human milk.
• From 12 months through older adulthood, follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet
nutrient needs, help achieve a healthy body weight, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.

2

Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect
personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations.

A healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age, race, or ethnicity, or current health
status. The Dietary Guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and
preferences, as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the United States.

3

Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages,
and stay within calorie limits.

An underlying premise of the Dietary Guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from
foods and beverages—specifically, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. Nutrient-dense foods provide
vitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting components and have no or little added sugars, saturated
fat, and sodium. A healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense forms of foods and beverages across
all food groups, in recommended amounts, and within calorie limits.
The core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include:
• Vegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and
other vegetables
• Fruits, especially whole fruit
• Grains, at least half of which are whole grain
• Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or lactose-free versions and fortified
soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives
• Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts,
seeds, and soy products
• Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts

Page ix | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary

4

Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and
limit alcoholic beverages.

At every life stage, meeting food group recommendations—even with nutrient-dense choices—requires most
of a person’s daily calorie needs and sodium limits. A healthy dietary pattern doesn’t have much room for
extra added sugars, saturated fat, or sodium—or for alcoholic beverages. A small amount of added sugars,
saturated fat, or sodium can be added to nutrient-dense foods and beverages to help meet food group
recommendations, but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited. Limits are:
• Added sugars—Less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2. Avoid foods and beverages with
added sugars for those younger than age 2.
• Saturated fat—Less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2.
• Sodium—Less than 2,300 milligrams per day—and even less for children younger than age 14.
• Alcoholic beverages—Adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink, or to drink in moderation by
limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is
consumed. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink
alcohol, such as women who are pregnant.

Terms to Know

Several terms are used throughout
the Dietary Guidelines and are
essential to understanding the
Guidelines and putting them into
action. These terms are defined here:
• Dietary pattern: It is the combination of
foods and beverages that constitutes
an individual’s complete dietary intake
over time. This may be a description of a
customary way of eating or a description
of a combination of foods recommended
for consumption.
• Nutrient dense: Nutrient-dense foods
and beverages provide vitamins, minerals,
and other health-promoting components
and have little added sugars, saturated
fat, and sodium. Vegetables, fruits, whole
grains, seafood, eggs, beans, peas, and
lentils, unsalted nuts and seeds, fat-free
and low-fat dairy products, and lean meats
and poultry—when prepared with no or little
added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium—
are nutrient-dense foods.

For most individuals, no matter their age or health status,
achieving a healthy dietary pattern will require changes in
food and beverage choices. Some of these changes can
be accomplished by making simple substitutions, while
others will require greater effort to accomplish. This edition
of the Dietary Guidelines presents overall guidance on
choosing nutrient-dense foods and beverages in place of
less healthy choices and also discusses special nutrition
considerations for individuals at each life stage—infants
and toddlers, children and adolescents, adults, women who
are pregnant or lactating, and older adults.
Although individuals ultimately decide what and how much
to consume, their personal relationships; the settings in
which they live, learn, work, play, and gather; and other
contextual factors—including their ability to consistently
access healthy and affordable food—strongly influence
their choices. Health professionals, communities,
businesses and industries, organizations, government,
and other segments of society all have a role to play in
supporting individuals and families in making choices
that align with the Dietary Guidelines and ensuring that
all people have access to a healthy and affordable food
supply. Resources, including Federal programs that support
households, regardless of size and make-up, in choosing
a healthy diet and improving access to healthy food, are
highlighted throughout this edition of the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans.

Setting the Stage

T

he foods and beverages that people consume have a profound
impact on their health. The scientific connection between food
and health has been well documented for many decades, with
substantial evidence showing that healthy dietary patterns can help
people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of
chronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan. Yet, Federal
data show that from the first edition of the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans in 1980 through today, Americans have fallen far short
of meeting its recommendations, and diet-related chronic disease
rates have risen to pervasive levels and continue to be a major public
health concern.
The Dietary Guidelines is an important part of a complex,
multifaceted approach to promote health and reduce
chronic disease risk. The Dietary Guidelines provides
science-based advice on what to eat and drink to
promote health, help reduce risk of chronic disease,
and meet nutrient needs. The Dietary Guidelines is
the foundation of Federal food, nutrition, and health
policies and programs. An important audience is health
professionals and nutrition program administrators
who work with the general public to help them
consume a healthy and nutritionally adequate diet and
establish policies and services to support these efforts.
Comprehensive, coordinated strategies built on the
science-based foundation of the Dietary Guidelines—and
a commitment to drive these strategies over time across
sectors and settings—can help all Americans consume
healthy dietary patterns, achieve and maintain good
health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Grounded in Science and Focused on
Public Health

The U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and of
Health and Human Services (HHS) update the Dietary
Guidelines at least every 5 years, based on the current
science. A fundamental premise of the Dietary Guidelines
is that everyone, no matter their age, race, or ethnicity,
economic circumstances, or health status, can benefit
from shifting food and beverage choices to better
support healthy dietary patterns.

Page 3 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction

To make sure that the dietary advice provided in the
Dietary Guidelines is aimed at improving public health,
the science used to inform the Guidelines has examined
diet through a lens of health promotion and disease
prevention and considered various segments of the
United States population, including ethnic populations
who have disproportionately and/or historically been
affected by diet-related disparities. This means that
priority has been placed on scientific studies that
examine the relationship between diet and health across
all life stages, in men, women, and children from diverse
racial and ethnic backgrounds, who are healthy or at risk
of chronic disease.
Over time, eating patterns in the United States have
remained far below Dietary Guidelines recommendations
(Figure I-1). Concurrently, it has become increasingly
clear that diet-related chronic diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, liver
disease, some types of cancer, and dental caries, pose
a major public health problem for Americans. Today,

60 percent of adults have one or more diet-related chronic
diseases (Table I-1). Given its aim to prevent further
disease incidence by promoting health and reducing
chronic disease risk, the Dietary Guidelines focuses on
the general public, including healthy individuals, as well
as those with overweight or obesity and those who are at
risk of chronic disease. The importance of following the
Dietary Guidelines across all life stages has been brought
into focus even more with the emergence of COVID-19,
as people living with diet-related chronic conditions and
diseases are at an increased risk of severe illness from
the novel coronavirus.
Grounded in the current body of scientific evidence
on diet and health that is relevant to all Americans,
the Dietary Guidelines is a critically important tool for
health professionals, policymakers, and many other
professionals. It is designed to help people make food
and beverage choices all through life that are enjoyable
and affordable and that also promote health and help
prevent chronic disease.

A Spotlight on Dietary Patterns

Although many of its recommendations have remained
relatively consistent over time, the Dietary Guidelines
has evolved as scientific knowledge has grown. Early
Dietary Guidelines editions used evidence that examined
the relationships between individual nutrients, foods,
and food groups and health outcomes. In recent years,
researchers, public health experts, and registered
dietitians have acknowledged that nutrients and
foods are not consumed in isolation. Rather, people
consume them in various combinations over time—a
dietary pattern—and these foods and beverages act
synergistically to affect health.
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines put this understanding
into action by focusing its recommendations on
consuming a healthy dietary pattern. The 2020-2025
Dietary Guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the
importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole—
rather than on individual nutrients or foods in isolation.
Serving as a framework, the Guidelines’ dietary patterns
approach enables policymakers, programs, and health
professionals to help people personalize their food
and beverage choices to accommodate their wants
and needs, food preferences, cultural traditions and
customs, and budgetary considerations.

Healthy Dietary Patterns at Every
Life Stage

The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines takes the dietary
patterns approach one step further by focusing on
the importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns
at every stage of life, from birth to older adulthood.
It provides recommendations for healthy dietary
patterns by life stage, identifying needs specific to
each life stage and considering healthy dietary pattern
characteristics that should be carried forward into the
next stage of life. And, for the first time since the 1985
edition, this edition of the Dietary Guidelines includes
recommendations for infants and toddlers as well as
continuing the emphasis on healthy dietary patterns
during pregnancy and lactation.
This approach recognizes that each life stage is
distinct—nutrient needs vary over the lifespan and
each life stage has unique implications for food and
beverage choices and disease risk. At the same time, it
recognizes an important continuity. Because early food
preferences influence later food choices, establishing a
healthy dietary pattern early in life may have a beneficial
impact on health promotion and disease prevention
over the course of decades.

Dietary Guidelines for
Americans: What It Is,
What It Is Not

population, including healthy individuals and people
at risk of diet-related chronic conditions and diseases,
such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or
obesity, and some people who are living with a dietrelated chronic illness.

The Dietary Guidelines translates the current science
on diet and health into guidance to help people choose
foods and beverages that comprise a healthy and
enjoyable dietary pattern—the “what” and “how much”
of foods and beverages to consume to achieve good
health, reduce risk of diet-related chronic diseases, and
meet nutrient needs. The Dietary Guidelines is just one
piece of the nutrition guidance landscape, however.
Other guidance is designed to address requirements for
the specific nutrients contained in foods and beverages
or to address treatments for individuals who have a
chronic disease. The following section describes the
role of the Dietary Guidelines within this larger nutrition
guidance landscape.

Because of this public health orientation, the Dietary
Guidelines is not intended to be a clinical guideline
for treating chronic diseases. However, the Dietary
Guidelines often has served as a reference for Federal,
medical, voluntary, and patient care organizations
as they develop clinical nutrition guidance tailored
for people living with a specific medical condition.
Chronic diseases result from a complex mix of
genetic, biological, behavioral, socioeconomic, and
environmental factors, and people with these conditions
have unique health care requirements that require
careful oversight by a health professional. Health
professionals can adapt the Dietary Guidelines to
meet the specific needs of their patients with chronic
diseases, as part of a multi-faceted treatment plan.

Quantitative Guidance on Foods,
Not Nutrient Requirements

Nutrient requirements are established and updated
by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine. At the request of the U.S. and Canadian
Federal Governments, the Academies set the
quantitative requirements or limits—known as Dietary
Reference Intakes (DRI)—on nutrients, which include
macronutrients (i.e., protein, carbohydrates, and fats),
vitamins and minerals (e.g., vitamin C, iron, and sodium),
and food components (e.g., dietary fiber).
Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other
components that have benefits for health, nutritional
needs should be met primarily through foods. Thus,
the Dietary Guidelines translates the Academies’
nutrient requirements into food and beverage
recommendations. The Dietary Guidelines recognizes,
though, that in some cases, fortified foods and
dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible
otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g.,
during specific life stages such as pregnancy).

Health Promotion, Not Disease Treatment
At its core, the Dietary Guidelines has a public health
mission—that is, health promotion and disease
prevention. Medical and nutrition professionals may
use or adapt the Dietary Guidelines to encourage their
patients or clients to follow a healthy dietary pattern.
The body of current scientific evidence on diet and
health reviewed to inform the Dietary Guidelines
included study participants who represent the U.S.

Page 7 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction

Developing the
Dietary Guidelines
for Americans
The process to develop the Dietary Guidelines has
evolved over time, in step with developments in nutrition
science, public health, and best practices in scientific
review and guidance development. USDA and HHS work
together to determine the approach for each edition.
As stipulated by law, USDA and HHS must update the
Dietary Guidelines at least every 5 years. The Guidelines
must be grounded in the body of scientific and medical
knowledge available at that time, not in individual
studies or individual expert opinion. In establishing the
process for the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines, USDA
and HHS considered and integrated recommendations
from a comprehensive 2017 National Academies’
study, Review of the Process to Update the Dietary
Guidelines. Greater transparency figured prominently
in the Academies’ recommendations. As a result, in
developing the 2020-2025 process, USDA and HHS
made significant changes to increase transparency and
public participation while maintaining the core element
of scientific integrity.
One of these changes was the addition of a new stage
at the beginning of the process. Thus, the 2020-2025
process consisted of four stages: (1) identify the topics

comments. Following review of the comments, USDA
and HHS posted the final topics and questions, along
with the public call for nominations to the 2020
Committee. Having topics and questions identified
upfront helped inform the public’s nominations by
defining which areas of nutrition expertise were needed
on the Committee.

Stage 1: Identify Topics and Supporting
Scientific Questions

Stage 2: Appoint a Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee To Review Current
Scientific Evidence

The Departments added a new step of identifying
topics and scientific questions to begin the process
of developing the next Dietary Guidelines. This was
done to promote a deliberate and transparent process,
better define the expertise needed on the Committee,
and ensure the scientific review conducted by the
Committee would address Federal nutrition policy and
program needs and help manage resources.
In consultation with agencies across the Federal
Government, USDA and HHS identified potential
topics and supporting scientific questions that were of
greatest importance and relevance to Federal nutrition
programs, policies, and consumer education priorities.
Compared to all previous Dietary Guidelines processes,
the topic areas for 2020-2025 expanded due to the
added focus on infants and toddlers from birth through
age 23 months, as well as women who are pregnant.
The Agricultural Act of 2014 mandated that, beginning
with the 2020-2025 edition, the Dietary Guidelines
should expand to include dietary guidance for these
populations. Thus, the topics and questions—and areas
of expertise needed on the Committee—reflected
this change.
The Departments posted the topics and questions
publicly on DietaryGuidelines.gov, allowing the public

In the second stage, the Secretaries of USDA and HHS
appointed the Committee with the single, time-limited
task of reviewing the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines,
examining the evidence on the selected nutrition
and public health topics and scientific questions,
and providing independent, science-based advice
and recommendations to USDA and HHS. The 20
nationally recognized scientific experts appointed to
the Committee represented a mix of practitioners,
epidemiologists, scientists, clinical trialists, and others
from every region of the United States.
The use of a Federal advisory committee is a commonly
used best practice to ensure the Federal Government
seeks sound, external scientific advice to inform
decisions. The Committee’s work concluded with its
scientific report submitted to the Secretaries of USDA
and HHS in June 2020.1 This report was not a draft of
the Dietary Guidelines; it was a scientific document that
detailed the Committee’s evidence review and provided
advice to USDA and HHS.
The Committee was divided into six subcommittees
to conduct its work: Dietary Patterns, Pregnancy and
Lactation, Birth to Age 24 Months, Beverages and
Added Sugars, Dietary Fats and Seafood, and Frequency

of Eating. The Committee also formed one cross-cutting
working group—Data Analysis and Food Pattern Modeling—
to support work across the subcommittees.
The Committee’s work had three defining characteristics:
the use of three approaches to examine the evidence,
the creation of transparent protocols before the evidence
review began, and the development of scientific review
conclusion statements for the scientific reviews conducted.
THREE APPROACHES TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE
The 2020 Committee used three state-of-the-art approaches
to conduct its robust and rigorous reviews:
Data analysis: Using Federal, nationally
representative data, this approach provided
insights into current eating habits of the U.S.
population and current diet-related chronic
disease rates in the United States. These data
helped make the Dietary Guidelines practical,
relevant, and achievable.
The Committee used data analysis to address
scientific questions that looked at current dietary
patterns and beverage consumption, current
intakes of food groups and nutrients, dietary
components of public health concern, prevalence
of nutrition-related chronic health conditions, and
relationships between eating habits and achieving
nutrient and food group recommendations.
Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR):
Systematic reviews are research projects that
follow meticulously defined protocols (i.e., plans)
to answer clearly formulated scientific questions
by searching for, evaluating, and synthesizing
all relevant, peer-reviewed studies. Systematic
reviews are considered a gold standard method to
inform development of evidence-based guidelines
by ensuring consideration of the strongest, most
appropriate body of evidence available on a topic.
USDA’s Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review is a
team of scientists who specializes in conducting
systematic reviews focused on nutrition and
disease prevention and evaluating scientific
evidence on nutrition topics relevant to Federal
policy and programs. NESR used its rigorous,
protocol-driven methodology to support the
Committee in conducting its systematic reviews.
New to the 2020 process, USDA and HHS added a
step for peer review of the systematic reviews by
Federal scientists.
Page 9 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction

Food pattern modeling: This type of analysis
illustrates how changes to the amounts or
types of foods and beverages in a dietary
pattern might affect meeting nutrient needs
across the U.S. population.
The Committee used this method to assess
potential changes to the USDA Dietary
Patterns, which help meet the DRIs set by
the National Academies, while taking into
consideration current consumption in the
United States and the conclusions from
its systematic reviews. As with all food
pattern modeling for the Dietary Guidelines,
the results of the Committee’s food pattern
modeling tests were interpreted in light of
two key assumptions. First, the modeling
tests were based on nutrient profiles of
nutrient-dense foods in the U.S. food supply
and U.S. population-based dietary data.
Population-based patterns articulate the
evidence on the relationships between diet
and health in ways that might be adopted by
the U.S. public as a whole. Second, modeling
tests assumed population-wide compliance
with all food intake recommendations.
As with other types of modeling, the food
pattern modeling is hypothetical and does
not predict the behaviors of individuals.
Each of these approaches had its own rigorous,
protocol-driven methodology, and each had a
unique, complementary role in examining the
science. Additional detailed information is available
at DietaryGuidelines.gov and NESR.usda.gov.

TRANSPARENT PROTOCOLS FIRST, THEN REVIEW
To answer each scientific question, the Committee
first created a protocol that described how the
Committee would apply one of the three approaches
to examine the evidence related to that specific
question. The Committee created each protocol
before examining any evidence, and, for the first time,
the protocols were posted online for the public as
they were being developed. This enabled the public
to understand how a specific scientific question
would be answered and to have the opportunity to
submit public comments before the Committee
completed the protocols and conducted its reviews
of the scientific evidence. Detailed information on the
Committee’s review is documented in its scientific
report, which is available on DietaryGuidelines.gov.

Health Status of Participants in
Studies Included in Nutrition
Evidence Systematic Reviews

To ensure that the Dietary Guidelines promotes
the health of and reduce risk of disease among
all Americans, the evidence base that informs
the Dietary Guidelines must comprise studies
conducted with people who are representative of
the general public and must examine diet through
a health promotion and disease prevention lens.
As outlined in the Committee’s systematic review
protocols, the Committee’s reviews included
studies with participants who were healthy and/
or who were at risk of a chronic disease, including
participants with obesity, as well as studies
that enrolled some participants with a disease.
Because the Dietary Guidelines is not intended to
be a clinical guideline for treating chronic diseases,
the Committee excluded studies that enrolled only
patients with a disease with the intention to treat
those individuals.
In general, the majority of the reviews conducted
to inform the Dietary Guidelines included trials that
exclusively enrolled participants with overweight or
obesity, or who were at high risk of cardiovascular
disease or type 2 diabetes, and observational
studies that enrolled participants from a wide
range of health and weight status, including those
with healthy weight, overweight, or obesity. The
reviews included few studies that enrolled only
healthy participants.
Thus, the Dietary Guidelines are applicable to
the overall U.S. population, including healthy
individuals and people at risk of diet-related
chronic conditions and diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and
obesity. In addition, people living with a dietrelated chronic illness can benefit from a healthy
dietary pattern. The Dietary Guidelines can serve
as a reference for Federal, medical, voluntary,
and patient care organizations as they develop
nutrition guidance tailored for people living with a
specific medical condition. Health professionals
can adapt the Dietary Guidelines to meet the
specific needs of their patients with chronic
diseases, as part of a multifaceted treatment plan.

CONCLUSION STATEMENTS FOR THE SCIENTIFIC
REVIEWS CONDUCTED
For all topics and questions, regardless of the
approach used to identify and evaluate the scientific
evidence, the Committee developed conclusion
statements. Each conclusion statement provided a
succinct answer to the specific question posed. The
Committee took the strengths and limitations of the
evidence base into consideration when formulating
conclusion statements.
For questions answered using NESR systematic
reviews, the conclusion statements included a grade
to indicate the strength of the evidence supporting
the conclusion statement. The grades were Strong,
Moderate, Limited, or Grade Not Assignable.

Grading the strength of the evidence applied only to
questions answered using NESR systematic reviews;
it did not apply to questions answered using data
analysis or food pattern modeling. Therefore, data
analysis and food pattern modeling conclusion
statements were not graded.
As it completed its work, the Committee looked
across all of the conclusion statements to develop
overarching advice for USDA and HHS to consider as
the Departments developed the next edition of the
Dietary Guidelines.
Using these three approaches, the Committee worked
collaboratively for 16 months and deliberated on the
scientific reviews in six meetings, all of which were
open to the public. Two of the six meetings included
an opportunity for the public to provide oral comments
to the Committee. An ongoing period for written public
comments to the Committee spanned 15 months of
its work. And, for the first time, a final public meeting
was included for the Committee to discuss its draft
scientific report 1 month before the final report was
posted for public comment.
In addition to documenting its rigorous review of the
evidence to answer the scientific questions from USDA
and HHS and providing advice for the Departments’
development of the next Dietary Guidelines edition,
the Committee provided recommendations for future
research. These research recommendations reflected
an acknowledgment that science in nutrition, diet, and
health associations continues to evolve, and that new
findings build on and enhance existing evidence.
Upon submitting its final scientific report to the USDA
and HHS Secretaries, the Committee disbanded. The
Departments then posted the scientific report and
asked the public for comments. The Departments
received written comments on the report over a
30-day period and also held an online meeting to
hear oral comments.

Stage 3: Develop the Dietary Guidelines

Each edition of the Dietary Guidelines builds on the
preceding edition, with the scientific justification
for revisions informed by the Committee’s scientific
report and consideration of public and Federal agency
comments. As with previous editions, development of
the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines involved a step-bystep process of writing, review, and revision conducted
by a writing team of Federal staff from USDA and HHS.

Page 11 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction

The writing team included Federal nutrition scientists
with expertise in the Dietary Guidelines and related
research and programs as well as specialists with
expertise in communicating nutrition information.
Key tenets of writing the Dietary Guidelines are that
it must:
• Represent the totality of the evidence examined
• Address the needs of Federal programs
• Reduce unintended consequences
• Follow best practices for developing guidelines
• Use plain language
The draft Dietary Guidelines went through internal and
external review. Ultimately, the document was reviewed
by all Agencies with nutrition policies and programs
across USDA and HHS, such as USDA’s Food and
Nutrition Service and its Food Safety and Inspection
Service, and HHS’ National Institutes of Health, Food and
Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. The draft Dietary Guidelines also went
through an external expert peer review to ensure that it
accurately reflected the body of evidence documented in
the Committee’s scientific report.

This process culminated with approval by the
Secretaries of USDA and HHS. After approval by the
Secretaries, the Departments released the Dietary
Guidelines to Federal agencies and the public for
implementation across programs and through
educational activities.

Stage 4: Implement the Dietary Guidelines

The U.S. Government uses the Dietary Guidelines as
the basis of its food assistance and meal programs,
nutrition education efforts, and decisions about national
health objectives. For example, the National School
Lunch Program and the Older Americans Act Nutrition
Program incorporate the Dietary Guidelines in menu
planning; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
for Women, Infants, and Children applies the Dietary
Guidelines in its program and educational materials;
and the Healthy People objectives for the Nation include
objectives based on the Dietary Guidelines.
The Dietary Guidelines also provides a critical structure
for State and local public health promotion and
disease prevention initiatives. In addition, it provides
foundational, evidence-based nutrition guidance for
use by individuals and those who serve them in public
and private settings, including health professionals,
public health and social service agencies, health care
and educational institutions, researchers, agricultural
producers, food and beverage manufacturers, and more.

Implementation of the Dietary Guidelines Through MyPlate

Using MyPlate as a Guide To Support Healthy
Dietary Patterns
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is developed and written for a professional audience. Therefore, its
translation into actionable consumer messages and resources is crucial to help individuals, families, and
communities achieve healthy dietary patterns.
MyPlate is one example of consumer translation. Created to be used in various settings and adaptable
to meeting personal preferences, cultural foodways, traditions, and budget needs, MyPlate is used by
professionals across sectors to help people become more aware of and informed about making healthy food
and beverage choices over time. More information is available at MyPlate.gov.
Following a healthy dietary pattern from birth through older adulthood can have a profound impact on a person’s
lifelong health. The Dietary Guidelines provides the framework for following such a pattern. However, broad and
multisector collaboration is needed to help people achieve that goal. Action on many fronts is needed to ensure
that healthy dietary choices at home, school, work, and play are the affordable, accessible norm. Everyone has a
role to play in helping all Americans shift to a healthy dietary pattern and achieve better health.

Try the MyPlate Plan

A healthy eating routine is important at every stage of life and can have positive effects that add up
over time. It’s important to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy or fortified soy alternatives,
and protein foods. When deciding what to eat or drink, choose options that are full of nutrients.
Make every bite count.
Think about how the following recommendations can come together over the course of your day or
week to help you create a healthy eating routine:
Make half your plate
fruits & vegetables.

A Roadmap to the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans, 2020-2025
Reflecting the accumulating body of evidence
about the relationships between diet and health
outcomes, the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines presents
its recommendations with a primary emphasis on
encouraging the consumption of a healthy overall
dietary pattern at every stage of life, from birth
through older adulthood. This edition of the Dietary
Guidelines consists of an Executive Summary, this
Introduction, six chapters, and three appendixes.
• Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across
the Lifespan: The Guidelines and Key
Recommendations discusses the health
benefits of lifelong healthy dietary choices and
explains the four Guidelines and supporting Key
Recommendations. This chapter is the basis for
all the succeeding chapters. Chapters 2 through 6
should be read in tandem with Chapter 1.
• Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers is the first of five
chapters that focus on healthy dietary patterns
for a specific life stage. This edition of the Dietary
Guidelines is the first since the 1985 edition to
provide guidance for infants and toddlers (birth
through age 23 months). The chapter provides
specific key recommendations for this age
group, along with guidance on how to put these
recommendations into action. The chapter closes
with a Healthy Dietary Pattern during the second
year of life and a look toward the next life stage—
Children and Adolescents.
• Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents first sets
the stage by describing nutrition issues specific
to children and adolescents ages 2 through 18. It
then presents the recommended Healthy Dietary
Patterns for this age group, explains how current
intakes compare to recommendations, and
discusses special dietary guidance considerations
for this life stage. The chapter concludes with
a discussion of ways to support healthy dietary
patterns among children and adolescents and a
look toward the next life stage—Adults.
• Chapter 4: Adults opens with a discussion of
selected nutrition issues that characterize the
adult life stage (ages 19 through 59). It then
presents the recommended Healthy Dietary

1

Patterns for this age group,
explains how current intakes
compare to recommendations,
and discusses special dietary
2
guidance considerations for
adults. The chapter concludes with
suggestions for how to support healthy
dietary patterns among adults and a look
toward two important adult life stages—Women
Who Are Pregnant or Lactating and Older Adults.
• Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant
or Lactating opens with a discussion of
selected nutrition issues important to this
stage of adult life. It then presents
the recommended Healthy Dietary
Patterns for this life stage,
explains how current intakes
compare to recommendations,
and discusses special dietary
4
guidance considerations for
women who are pregnant
or lactating. The chapter
concludes with suggestions
for how to support healthy
dietary patterns among this
population group.

• Chapter 6: Older Adults opens with a
discussion of selected nutrition issues that
are important for older adults, ages 60 and
older. It then presents the recommended
Healthy Dietary Patterns for this life
stage, explains how current intakes
compare to recommendations, and
discusses special dietary guidance
considerations for this age group.
The chapter concludes with
suggestions for how to support
healthy dietary patterns among
older adults.
• Appendixes include a table
summarizing nutritional goals for
age-sex groups, estimated calorie
needs for all ages and at three
physical activity levels, and the USDA
Dietary Patterns.

Key Recommendations
Guideline

Follow a healthy dietary pattern at
every life stage.

At every life stage—infancy, toddlerhood,
childhood, adolescence, adulthood,
pregnancy, lactation, and older
adulthood—it is never too early or too late
to eat healthfully.

1

• For about the first 6 months of life, exclusively feed
infants human milk. Continue to feed infants human
milk through at least the first year of life, and longer
if desired. Feed infants iron-fortified infant formula
during the first year of life when human milk is
unavailable. Provide infants with supplemental vitamin
D beginning soon after birth.
• At about 6 months, introduce infants to nutrient-dense
complementary foods. Introduce infants to potentially
allergenic foods along with other complementary
foods. Encourage infants and toddlers to consume a
variety of foods from all food groups. Include foods rich
in iron and zinc, particularly for infants fed human milk.
• From 12 months through older adulthood, follow a
healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet
nutrient needs, help achieve a healthy body weight,
and reduce the risk of chronic disease.

Guideline

2

Customize and enjoy nutrientdense food and beverage choices
to reflect personal preferences,
cultural traditions, and budgetary
considerations.

A healthy dietary pattern can benefit
all individuals regardless of age, race, or
ethnicity, or current health status. The Dietary
Guidelines provides a framework intended to be
customized to individual needs and preferences, as
well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the
United States.

Guideline

Focus on meeting food group
needs with nutrient-dense foods
and beverages, and stay within
calorie limits.

An underlying premise of the Dietary
Guidelines is that nutritional needs
should be met primarily from foods and
beverages—specifically, nutrient-dense foods
and beverages. Nutrient-dense foods provide vitamins,
minerals, and other health-promoting components and
have no or little added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
A healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense
3

forms of foods and beverages across all food groups, in
recommended amounts, and within calorie limits.
The core elements that make up a healthy dietary
pattern include:
• Vegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange;
beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and other vegetables
• Fruits, especially whole fruit
• Grains, at least half of which are whole grain
• Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and
cheese, and/or lactose-free versions and fortified soy
beverages and yogurt as alternatives
• Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs;
seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and
soy products
• Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as
seafood and nuts

Guideline

4

Limit foods and beverages higher
in added sugars, saturated fat,
and sodium, and limit alcoholic
beverages.

At every life stage, meeting food group
recommendations—even with nutrientdense choices—requires most of a person’s
daily calorie needs and sodium limits. A healthy
dietary pattern doesn’t have much room for extra
added sugars, saturated fat, or sodium—or for alcoholic
beverages. A small amount of added sugars, saturated
fat, or sodium can be added to nutrient-dense foods and
beverages to help meet food group recommendations,
but foods and beverages high in these components
should be limited. Limits are:
• Added sugars—Less than 10 percent of calories per
day starting at age 2. Avoid foods and beverages with
added sugars for those younger than age 2.
• Saturated fat—Less than 10 percent of calories per
day starting at age 2.
• Sodium—Less than 2,300 milligrams per day—and
even less for children younger than age 14.
• Alcoholic beverages—Adults of legal drinking age can
choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting
intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink
or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed.
Drinking less is better for health than drinking more.
There are some adults who should not drink alcohol,
such as women who are pregnant.

Guideline 1

Follow a Healthy Dietary Pattern at
Every Life Stage
A fundamental premise of the Dietary Guidelines is
that almost everyone, no matter an individual’s age,
race, or ethnicity, or health status, can benefit from
shifting food and beverage choices to better support
healthy dietary patterns.
Healthy eating starts at birth with the exclusive
consumption of human milk, if possible, for about the
first 6 months. If human milk is unavailable, infants
should be fed an iron-fortified commercial infant
formula (i.e., labeled “with iron”) regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are
based on standards that ensure nutrient content and
safety. Healthy eating continues with the introduction
of complementary foods and beverages at about
6 months of age. By 12 months, infants should
maintain their healthy eating as they transition to
developmentally appropriate foods and beverages.
Healthy eating continues in each life stage thereafter.
Even though nutrient needs vary across life stages, the
foods and beverages that individuals should eat over
the lifespan are remarkably consistent.
This chapter provides foundational guidance about
maintaining a healthy dietary pattern across each life
stage—infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence,
adulthood, pregnancy, lactation, and older adulthood.
Because the nutritional needs and transition of infants
and toddlers are unique, Chapter 2 provides a focused
discussion on this age group. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6
then provide tailored nutrition information specific
to children and adolescents, adults, women who are
pregnant or lactating, and older adults, respectively.

What Is a Dietary Pattern?

Over the course of any given day, week, or year,
individuals consume foods and beverages1 in
combination—a dietary pattern. A dietary pattern
represents the totality of what individuals habitually
eat and drink, and the parts of the pattern act
synergistically to affect health. As a result, the dietary
pattern may better predict overall health status and
disease risk than individual foods or nutrients.
A healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense
1

forms of foods and beverages across all food groups,
in recommended amounts, and within calorie limits.
Achieving a healthy dietary pattern at each life stage
not only supports health at that point in time, but also
supports health in the next life stage and possibly for
future generations. If healthy dietary patterns can be
established early in life and sustained thereafter, the
impact on health could be significant. Establishing
and maintaining a healthy dietary pattern can help
minimize diet-related chronic disease risk. Conversely,
consuming foods and beverages that are not nutrientdense may lead to disease expression in later years.
High intakes of such foods (i.e., an unhealthy dietary
pattern) throughout the lifespan can increase the risk of
developing chronic diseases.
The good news is that at any stage of life, individuals
can make efforts to adopt a healthy dietary pattern
and improve their health. The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern, USDA’s primary Dietary Pattern, provides a
framework for healthy eating that all Americans can
follow. It is based on the types and proportions of foods
Americans of all ages, genders, races, and ethnicities
typically consume, but in nutrient-dense forms and
appropriate amounts.
The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern is carried forward
from the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
The 2,000-calorie level of the pattern is shown in
Table 1-1. The Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary
Pattern and the Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern—
also carried forward from the 2015-2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans—are variations of the Healthy
U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern that have the same core
elements. The USDA Dietary Patterns are described in
Appendix 3. USDA Dietary Patterns and are meant to
be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences
and used as guides to plan and serve meals for
individuals, households, and in a variety of institutions
and other settings. The Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is an example of
a healthy dietary pattern and has many of the same
characteristics as the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern.
Additional details on DASH are available at nhlbi.nih.

of food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, saturated fat,
and/or alcohol, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.
NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol; be within the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded. See Appendix 3 for

The Health Benefits of a Healthy
Dietary Pattern

Science is the foundation of the Dietary Guidelines
recommendations on what Americans should eat
and drink to promote health, reduce risk of chronic
disease, and meet nutrient needs. The science shows
that consuming a healthy dietary pattern, meeting food
group and nutrient needs with nutrient-dense foods and
beverages, and limiting intake of foods and beverages
that are not nutrient-dense is related to many health
benefits. Science also supports the idea that every life
stage provides an opportunity to make food choices
that promote health and well-being, achieve and
maintain appropriate weight status, and reduce risk of
diet-related chronic disease.
The science supporting the Dietary Guidelines is
extensively documented in the Scientific Report of the
2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which
describes the state of the science on key topics related
to diet and health. Outcomes with Strong or Moderate
evidence are provided in Figure 1-3. The report is
available at DietaryGuidelines.gov.
Evidence on the association between dietary
patterns and reduced risk of diet-related chronic
diseases has expanded in recent years and supports
the use of dietary patterns as a foundation for
the recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans, 2020-2025. Consistent evidence
demonstrates that a healthy dietary pattern is
associated with beneficial outcomes for all-cause
mortality, cardiovascular disease, overweight and
obesity, type 2 diabetes, bone health, and certain types
of cancer (breast and colorectal).
Common characteristics of dietary patterns associated
with positive health outcomes include relatively higher
intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains,

low- or non-fat dairy, lean meats and poultry,
seafood, nuts, and unsaturated vegetable
oils, and relatively lower consumption of red
and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and
beverages, and refined grains. The evidence examined
showed broad representation across a number of
populations and demographic groups. This suggests a
consistent association no matter the region or cultural
context in which a healthy dietary pattern is consumed.
In addition, dietary patterns characterized by higher
intake of red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened
foods and beverages, and refined grains are, in and
of themselves, associated with detrimental health
outcomes. These findings are consistent with—and
build on—the evidence base that informed the 20152020 Dietary Guidelines.

A Healthy Dietary Pattern Supports
Appropriate Calorie Levels

The total number of calories a person needs each day
varies depending on a number of factors, namely the
person’s age, sex, height, weight, level of physical activity,
and pregnancy or lactation status. Due to reductions
in basal metabolic rate that occur with aging, calorie
needs generally decrease for adults as they age. In
addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight affects
how many calories should be consumed. Estimated
amounts of calories needed based on age, sex, and
level of physical activity are provided in Appendix 2.
Estimated Calorie Needs, and estimated calorie needs
relevant for different ages are provided in each life stage
chapter. These estimates are based on the Estimated
Energy Requirement (EER) equations established by
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine (National Academies) using reference heights
(average) and reference weights (healthy) for each
age-sex group. These amounts are estimates. The best
way to evaluate calorie intake, in comparison to calorie
needs, is by measuring body weight status.

Rather than focus on weight status at any one point in life, the Dietary Guidelines supports
healthy weight trajectories at each stage of life—appropriate weight gain during pregnancy
and postpartum weight loss, healthy growth and development from infancy through
adolescence, weight stability during mid-life, and healthy body composition late in life.
Meeting the Dietary Guidelines recommendations within calorie needs can help prevent
excess weight gain at every life stage and support overall good health.

Key Dietary Principles

To help people meet the Guidelines and Key Recommendations, the
following are important principles when making decisions about nutrientdense food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy dietary pattern.
MEET NUTRITIONAL NEEDS PRIMARILY FROM FOODS
AND BEVERAGES
The Dietary Guidelines are designed to meet the Recommended Dietary
Allowances and Adequate Intakes for essential nutrients, as well as
Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges, all set by the National
Academies. An underlying premise of the Dietary Guidelines is that
nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beverages—
specifically, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. In some cases, when
meeting nutrient needs is not otherwise possible, fortified foods and
nutrient-containing dietary supplements are useful. It is important to note
that the nutrient density and healthfulness of what people eat and drink
often is determined ultimately by how a food item, dish, or meal is prepared,
at home and away from home or produced by a manufacturer. Based on
the U.S. food supply and marketplace, the examples of healthy dietary
patterns in this edition are achievable through thoughtful, informed choices
one decision, one meal, one day at a time—and consistently over time.
CHOOSE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FROM EACH FOOD GROUP
Enjoy different foods and beverages within each food group. This can
help meet nutrient needs—and also allows for flexibility so that the Dietary
Guidelines can be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences.
All forms of foods, including fresh, canned, dried, frozen, and 100% juices,
in nutrient-dense forms, can be included in healthy dietary patterns.
PAY ATTENTION TO PORTION SIZE
Portion size is a term often used to describe the amount of a food or
beverage served or consumed in one eating occasion. It is important to
pay attention to portion size when making food and beverage choices,
particularly for foods and beverages that are not nutrient-dense. A concept
that can help people choose appropriate portions is serving size. This term
is included on the Nutrition Facts label and refers to the amount of a food
or beverage that is customarily consumed—it is not a recommendation
of how much to eat or drink. Consuming less than the stated serving
size results in consuming fewer calories and other nutrients or food
components. Some products may have multiple servings per package.

Most Americans Do Not Follow a Healthy Dietary Pattern

The typical dietary patterns currently consumed by many in the United States do not align with the Dietary
Guidelines (Figure 1-4). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) is a measure of diet quality that can be used to assess
compliance with the Dietary Guidelines. For Americans ages 2 and older, HEI-2015 scores indicate that intakes are
not consistent with recommendations for a healthy dietary pattern. Average diet quality has slightly improved in
the past 10 years, but the average score of 59 (on a scale from 0 to 100) indicates that people have much room for
improvement. Differences in overall HEI scores are seen across age, sex, race-ethnic, and income subgroups and
by pregnancy and lactation status, though poor diet quality is observed across all groups. With each step closer to
a diet that aligns with the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern, HEI scores will increase and risk for chronic
disease will decrease.

A higher total score indicates a higher quality diet.
Data Source: Analysis of What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016, ages 2 and older, day 1 dietary intake data, weighted.

In addition, the high percentage of the population with overweight or obesity suggests that many people in the United
States consume foods and beverages that contribute to a calorie imbalance, a situation more likely to occur with low
physical activity. As shown in the Introduction, Table I-1, 74 percent of all adults and 40 percent of all children and
youth in the United States have either overweight or obesity.
Even from the youngest ages, almost all Americans should shift to healthier food and beverage choices and
consume smaller portions to achieve a healthy dietary pattern within an appropriate number of calories. It is never
too early or too late to improve intake and establish a healthy dietary pattern.

Guideline 2

Customize and Enjoy Food and Beverage
Choices to Reflect Personal Preferences,
Cultural Traditions, and Budgetary
Considerations
Eating should be enjoyed, and
a healthy dietary pattern can be
enjoyable, from early life to older
adulthood. The science reviewed
to inform the Dietary Guidelines
represents the diversity of
Americans, including all ages and
life stages, different racial
and ethnic backgrounds, and a
range of socioeconomic statuses.
A healthy dietary pattern can
benefit all individuals regardless
of age, race or ethnicity, or current
health status.
The Dietary Guidelines provides
a framework intended to be
customized to fit individual,
household, and Federal program
participants’ preferences, as well
as the foodways of the diverse
cultures in the United States. The
U.S. population is diverse in myriad
ways. The Dietary Guidelines
framework purposely provides
recommendations by food groups
and subgroups—not specific
foods and beverages—to avoid
being prescriptive. This framework
approach ensures that people can
“make it their own” by selecting
healthy foods, beverages, meals,
and snacks specific to their needs
and preferences.
The food groups include a broad
variety of nutrient-dense food and
beverage choices. In every setting,
across all cultures, and at any age
or budget, there are foods and
beverages that can fit within the
Dietary Guidelines framework.

Start with Personal Preferences

Exposure to different types of food is important
early in life to better develop a child’s interest and
willingness to eat and enjoy a variety of foods.
Through each life stage that follows, a key starting
point for establishing and maintaining a healthy
dietary pattern is to ensure that individual and/or
family preferences—in nutrient-dense forms—are
built into day-to-day choices.

Incorporate Cultural Traditions

Cultural background can have significant influence
on food and beverage choices. Customizing the
Dietary Guidelines framework to reflect specific
cultures and traditions is an important strategy
to help communities across the country eat and
enjoy a healthy dietary pattern. Nutrient-dense
culturally relevant foods and beverages are part
of all of the food groups. Spices and herbs can
help flavor foods when reducing added sugars,
saturated fat, and sodium, and they also can add
to the enjoyment of nutrient-dense foods, dishes,
and meals that reflect specific cultures. Relying on
the expertise of professionals in nutrition and in
specific cultural foodways can help people prepare
foods healthfully while retaining heritage.

Consider Budget

Despite a common perception that eating
healthfully is expensive, a healthy dietary pattern
can be affordable and fit within budgetary
constraints. There are a range of strategies that
can be used to help individuals and families follow
a healthy dietary pattern including advanced
planning; considering regional and seasonal food
availability; and incorporating a variety of fresh,
frozen, dried, and canned options. The USDA
Food Plans—Thrifty, Low-Cost, Moderate-Cost,
and Liberal-Cost food plans—each represent
a nutritious diet at a different cost level. These
plans are scheduled to be revised, with an updated
Thrifty Food Plan published by the end of 2022 to
reflect this edition of the Dietary Guidelines and
updated food availability and food cost data.

Focus on Meeting Food Group Needs With
Nutrient-Dense Foods and Beverages,
and Stay Within Calorie Limits
The Dietary Guidelines include recommendations for food groups—vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, and protein foods—
eaten at an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
Science shows that these same core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are consistent across each life stage.
However, as shown in Figure 1-6, when compared to the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, most Americans have
substantial room for improvement:
• More than 80 percent have dietary patterns that are low in vegetables, fruits, and dairy.
• More than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations,
but are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups.

Table A3-2 in Appendix
3 provides the food
group-based Healthy
U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern as a sample
framework. Information
on what counts as a
cup- or ounce-equivalent
is also provided under
this table in footnote c.

About Beans, Peas, and Lentils

“Beans, peas, and lentils” is a new name for the
vegetable subgroup formerly called “legumes
(beans and peas).” Beans, peas, and lentils, which
also are known as pulses, include the dried edible
seeds of legumes. The foods in this vegetable
subgroup have not changed. However, the new
name of the subgroup more accurately reflects
the category of foods included. Beans include
varieties such as kidney beans, pinto beans, white
beans, black beans, lima beans, and fava beans.
Also included are dried peas (e.g., chickpeas,
black-eyed peas, pigeon peas, and split peas) and
lentils. Edamame, which is the soybean in the pod,
is counted in the beans, peas, and lentils subgroup
even though it is eaten fresh and not dried.
Because beans, peas, and lentils have a similar
nutrient profile to foods in both the vegetable
group and the protein foods group, they may be
thought of as either a vegetable or a protein food
when aiming to meet recommended intakes.
Green peas and green (string) beans are
not counted in the beans, peas, and lentils
subgroup because the nutrient content of these
vegetables is more similar to vegetables in other
subgroups. Green peas, which are not dried before
consumption, are grouped with starchy vegetables
and green beans are in the other vegetables
subgroup, which includes onions, iceberg lettuce,
celery, and cabbage. Generally, foods made from
processed soybeans are a part of the nuts, seeds
and soy products protein foods subgroup.

3
The following sections use the Healthy U.S.-Style
Dietary Pattern to show how people can make shifts
in their choices to achieve a healthy dietary pattern.
Information on the amounts to consume—in cup and ounce
equivalents—for each life stage is discussed in the subsequent
life stage chapters and Appendix 3. USDA Dietary Patterns.

Eating an appropriate mix of foods from the food groups and
subgroups—within an appropriate calorie level—is important
to promote health at each life stage. Each of the food groups
and their subgroups provides an array of nutrients, and the
amounts recommended reflect eating patterns that have been
associated with positive health outcomes. Foods from all of
the food groups should be eaten in nutrient-dense forms. The
following sections describe special considerations related to
each food group.

Vegetables

Healthy dietary patterns include a variety of vegetables
from all five vegetable subgroups—dark green; red and orange;
beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and other. These include
all fresh, frozen, canned, and dried options in cooked or raw
forms, including 100% vegetable juices. Vegetables in their
nutrient-dense forms have limited additions such as salt,
butter, or creamy sauces. Examples of vegetables in each of
the subgroups are available in Appendix 3.
Almost 90 percent of the U.S. population does not meet
the recommendation for vegetables. In addition, with
few exceptions, the U.S. population does not meet intake
recommendations for any of the vegetable subgroups. About
45 percent of all vegetables are eaten as a separate food item;
about 40 percent as part of a mixed dish; and the remainder
are mostly consumed as snack foods and condiments.
Vegetables, when consumed on their own, are generally
consumed in forms with additional sodium either from salt
added in cooking or added sauces such as soy sauce or
bottled stir-fry sauces. Many vegetables are consumed as part
of mixed dishes like sandwiches, pasta with a tomato-based
sauce, or casseroles that may have other ingredients that are
sources of saturated fat and/or sodium.
For most individuals, following a healthy eating pattern will
require an increase in total vegetable intake and from all
vegetable subgroups, shifting to nutrient-dense forms, and
an increase in the variety of different vegetables consumed
over time. Vegetables can be part of many types of mixed
dishes, from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos, to pizza, stews,
pasta dishes, grain-based casseroles, and soups. Strategies
to increase vegetable intake include increasing the vegetable
content of mixed dishes or eating less of a main dish to
allow for more vegetables as side dishes—keeping these
nutrient dense.

Fruits

The fruit food group includes whole fruits and 100% fruit
juice. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and
dried forms. Whole fruits can be eaten in various forms,
such as cut, sliced, diced, or cubed. At least half of the
recommended amount of fruit should come from whole
fruit, rather than 100% juice. When juices are consumed,
they should be 100% juice and always pasteurized or
100% juice diluted with water (without added sugars).
Also, when selecting canned fruit, choose options
that are canned with 100% juice or options lowest in
added sugars.
About 80 percent of the U.S. population does not meet
fruit recommendations. Over 60 percent of all fruit
intake comes from whole forms—fresh, canned, frozen,
or dried—or 100% juice. Fruit is generally consumed in
nutrient-dense forms such as plain bananas, apples,
oranges, or grapes. However, some fruit is consumed as
part of foods that may not be nutrient-dense, such as fruit
pie or similar desserts.
Most people would benefit from increasing their intake
of fruit, mostly as whole fruits in nutrient-dense forms. A
wide variety of fruits are available in the U.S. marketplace,
some year-round and others seasonally. Strategies to
help achieve this shift include choosing more whole fruits
as snacks and including them in meals.

Grains

Healthy dietary patterns include whole grains and limit
the intake of refined grains. At least half of total grains
should be whole grains. Individuals who eat refined grains
should choose enriched grains. Individuals who consume
all of their grains as whole grains should include some
that have been fortified with folic acid. Grain-based foods
in nutrient-dense forms limit the additions of added
sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
A food is a 100% whole-grain food if the only grains
it contains are whole grains. A 1 ounce-equivalent of
100% whole grains has 16 grams of whole grains. The
recommendation to consume at least half of total grains
as whole grains can be met in a number of ways.
• Choose 100% whole-grain foods for at least half of all
grains consumed. The relative amount of whole grain in
the food can be inferred by the placement of the grain
in the ingredient list. The whole grain should be the first
ingredient—or the second ingredient after water. For
foods with multiple whole-grain ingredients, they should
appear near the beginning of the ingredient list.

• Choose products with at least 50 percent of the total
weight as whole-grain ingredients. If a food has at least
8 grams of whole grains per ounce-equivalent then half
of the grains are whole-grain ingredients.
Most Americans meet recommendations for total grain
intakes, although 98 percent fall below recommendations
for whole grains and 74 percent exceed limits for refined
grains. Almost half of all intake of refined grains is from
mixed dishes, such as sandwiches, burgers, tacos, pizza,
macaroni and cheese, and spaghetti with meatballs.
About 20 percent of intake of refined grains comes from
snacks and sweets, including crackers, pretzels, cakes,
cookies, and other grain desserts. The remaining refined
grains are generally eaten as separate food items, such
as pancakes, cereals, breads, tortillas, pasta, or rice.
About 60 percent of whole-grain intake in the United
States is from individual food items, mostly cereals and
crackers, rather than mixed dishes. Grains are generally
consumed in forms with higher amounts of sodium (e.g.,
breads, tortillas, crackers) and added sugars (e.g., grainbased desserts, many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals)
rather than the nutrient-dense forms. Further, grains are
often consumed as part of mixed dishes, such as pasta
dishes, casseroles, and sandwiches that may have other
ingredients that are not in nutrient-dense forms.
Shifting from refined to whole-grain versions of
commonly consumed foods—such as from white to
100% whole-wheat breads, and white to brown rice
where culturally appropriate—would increase whole-grain
intakes and lower refined grain intakes to help meet
recommendations. Additionally, shifting to more nutrientdense forms of grains, such as ready-to-eat breakfast
cereals with less sugar, will help meet healthy dietary
patterns. With careful planning, limited amounts of salt,
butter, or sources of added sugars can be used to make

some grain-based foods more palatable while staying
within calorie and nutrient limits, but most grains should
be eaten in their most nutrient-dense forms. Reducing
intakes of cakes, cookies, and other grain desserts will
also support reducing refined grain intakes and staying
within calorie needs.

(including lactose-free milk), yogurt, and cheese, or
from fortified soy beverages or soy yogurt. Strategies
to increase dairy intake include drinking fat-free or
low-fat milk or a fortified soy beverage with meals or
incorporating unsweetened fat-free or low-fat yogurt into
breakfast or snacks.

Dairy and Fortified Soy Alternatives

Protein Foods

Healthy dietary patterns feature dairy, including fat-free
and low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, and cheese. Individuals
who are lactose intolerant can choose low-lactose and
lactose-free dairy products. For individuals who choose
dairy alternatives, fortified soy beverages (commonly
known as “soy milk”) and soy yogurt—which are fortified
with calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin D—are included as
part of the dairy group because they are similar to milk
and yogurt based on nutrient composition and in their
use in meals.
Other products sold as “milks” but made from plants
(e.g., almond, rice, coconut, oat, and hemp “milks”)
may contain calcium and be consumed as a source
of calcium, but they are not included as part of the
dairy group because their overall nutritional content is
not similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages.
Therefore, consuming these beverages does not
contribute to meeting the dairy group recommendation.
About 90 percent of the U.S. population does not meet
dairy recommendations. The percent of Americans who
drink milk as a beverage on a given day is 65 percent
among young children, 34 percent in adolescents, and
about 20 percent for adults. Dairy is generally consumed
in forms with higher amounts of sodium (e.g., cheeses
as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches, pizza, and
pasta dishes) and saturated fat (e.g., higher fat milks and
yogurts) and can be a source of added sugars such as
flavored milk, ice cream, and sweetened yogurts.
Most individuals would benefit by increasing intake of
dairy in fat-free or low-fat forms, whether from milk

Healthy dietary patterns include a variety of protein
foods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group
comprises a broad group of foods from both animal and
plant sources, and includes several subgroups: meats,
poultry, and eggs; seafood; and nuts, seeds, and soy
products. As noted previously, beans, peas, and lentils
may be considered a part of the protein foods group
as well as the vegetable group. Protein also is found
in some foods from other food groups, such as dairy.
Meats and poultry vary in fat content and include both
fresh and processed forms. Most intake of meats and
poultry should be from fresh, frozen, or canned, and
in lean forms (e.g., chicken breast or ground turkey)
versus processed meats (e.g., hot dogs, sausages, ham,
luncheon meats).
A healthy vegetarian dietary pattern can be achieved
by incorporating protein foods from plants. Compared
with the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, the Healthy
Vegetarian Dietary Pattern is higher in soy products
(particularly tofu and other processed soy products);
beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and whole
grains. Inclusion of dairy and eggs make this an
example of a lacto-ovo vegetarian pattern. Meats,
poultry, and seafood are not included.
Seafood, which includes fish and shellfish, is a protein
foods subgroup that provides beneficial fatty acids (e.g.,
eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic
acid [DHA]). In addition, mercury, in the form of
methylmercury, is found in seafood in varying levels.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide

Page 33 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan

Guideline

joint advice regarding seafood consumption to limit
methylmercury exposure for women who might become
or are pregnant or lactating and young children.2
Seafood choices higher in EPA and DHA and lower
in methylmercury are encouraged. Seafood varieties
commonly consumed in the United States that are higher
in EPA and DHA and lower in methylmercury include
salmon, anchovies, sardines, Pacific oysters, and trout.
Tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, and flounder are commonly
consumed varieties that also are lower in methylmercury.
Intakes of protein foods are close to the target amounts,
but many Americans do not meet recommendations
for specific protein subgroups. About three-quarters
of Americans meet or exceed the recommendation for
meats, poultry, and eggs. However, almost 90 percent
do not meet the recommendation for seafood and more
than half do not meet the recommendation for nuts,
seeds, and soy products. Slightly less than half (43%)
of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food
item, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish
2

filet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are
3
consumed as part of a mixed dish (48%), with
the largest amount from sandwiches including
burgers and tacos. Protein foods are generally consumed
in forms with higher amounts of saturated fat or sodium
and often part of mixed dishes (e.g., sandwiches,
casseroles, pasta dishes) that include other ingredients
that are not in nutrient-dense forms.
Shifts are needed within the protein foods group to
add variety to subgroup intakes. Selecting from the
seafood subgroup or the beans, peas, and lentils
subgroup more often could help meet recommendations
while still ensuring adequate protein consumption.
Replacing processed or high-fat meats (e.g., hot dogs,
sausages, bacon) with seafood could help lower intake
of saturated fat and sodium, nutrients that are often
consumed in excess of recommended limits. Replacing
processed or high-fat meats with beans, peas, and lentils
would have similar benefits, as well as increasing dietary
fiber, a dietary component of public health concern.

Follow Food Safety Recommendations

An important part of healthy eating is keeping food safe. Individuals in their own homes can help keep
food safe by following safe food handling practices. Four basic food safety principles work together to
reduce the risk of foodborne illness—Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill.
1: Clean
Wash hands and
surfaces often.

2: Separate
Separate raw meats
from other foods.

3: Cook
Cook food to safe
internal temperatures.

4: Chill
Refrigerate foods
promptly.

Some eating behaviors, such as consuming raw, undercooked, or unpasteurized food products, increase the risk of
contracting a foodborne illness. Populations at increased risk of foodborne illness, or those preparing food for them,
should use extra caution. These include women who are pregnant, young children, and older adults. Specific guidance
for these life stages is discussed in subsequent chapters. Individuals with weakened immune systems are also at
increased risk for foodborne illness. More information about food safety is available at:
• Your Gateway to Food Safety: foodsafety.gov
• USDA Food Safety Education campaigns: fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/teachothers/fsis-educational-campaigns

Oils

Oils are important to consider as part of a healthy dietary pattern as they provide essential fatty acids. Commonly
consumed oils include canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils. Oils also are naturally
present in nuts, seeds, seafood, olives, and avocados. The fat in some tropical plants, such as coconut oil, palm
kernel oil, and palm oil, are not included in the oils category because they contain a higher percentage of saturated
fat than do other oils.
Strategies to shift intake include cooking with vegetable oil in place of fats high in saturated fat, including butter,
shortening, lard, or coconut oil. However, some foods, such as desserts and sweet snacks, that are prepared with
oils instead of fats high in saturated fat are still high in added sugars, and are thus not a nutrient-dense food choice.

Beverages

When choosing beverages in a healthy dietary pattern, both the calories and nutrients that they provide are important
considerations. Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as
fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Coffee, tea, and flavored
waters also are options, but the most nutrient-dense options for these beverages include little, if any, sweeteners or
cream. For discussion on sugar-sweetened beverages or alcohol, see “Added Sugars” and “Alcoholic Beverages,”
respectively.
CAFFEINE
Caffeine is a dietary component that functions in the body as a stimulant. Most intake of caffeine in the United
States comes from coffee, tea, and soda. Caffeine is a substance that is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in
cola-type beverages by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For healthy adults, the FDA has cited 400 milligrams
per day of caffeine as an amount not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects. Additional information
related to caffeine is provided in subsequent life stage chapters.

Beverages and Added Sugars

Examples of beverages that often have added
sugars are regular soda (i.e., not sugar-free), fruit
drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened
waters, and coffee and tea beverages with added
sugars. Coffee and tea beverages from restaurants
can contain many extra calories because of the
addition of cream or milk and sugar. See below

added sugars and total calories.

Dietary Components of Public Health
Concern for Underconsumption

Current inadequate intake of nutrient-dense foods
and beverages across food groups has resulted in
underconsumption of some nutrients and dietary
components. Calcium, potassium, dietary fiber, and
vitamin D are considered dietary components of
public health concern for the general U.S. population
because low intakes are associated with health
concerns. Additional dietary components that are
underconsumed during specific life stages are
highlighted in subsequent chapters.
If a healthy dietary pattern is consumed, amounts
of calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber can meet
recommendations. Individuals should be encouraged
to make shifts to increase the intake of vegetables,
fruits, beans, whole grains, and dairy to move intakes
of these underconsumed dietary components closer to
recommendations. In some cases, fortified foods and
dietary supplements may be useful in providing one
or more nutrients that otherwise may be consumed
in less than recommended amounts. Vitamin D
recommendations are harder to achieve through
natural sources from diet alone and would require
consuming foods and beverages fortified with vitamin
D. In many cases, taking a vitamin D supplement may
be appropriate especially when sunlight exposure is
limited due to climate or the use of sunscreen. Lists
of dietary sources of calcium, potassium, dietary fiber,
and vitamin D are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov.

Limit Foods and Beverages Higher in
Added Sugars, Saturated Fat, and Sodium,
and Limit Alcoholic Beverages
A healthy dietary pattern is designed to meet food group and nutrient recommendations while staying within
calorie needs. Additionally, a healthy dietary pattern is designed to not exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake Level
(UL) or Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) level for nutrients. To achieve these goals, the pattern is based on
consuming foods and beverages in their nutrient-dense forms—forms with the least amounts of added sugars,
saturated fat, and sodium.
Most of the calories a person needs to eat each day—around 85 percent—are needed to meet food group
recommendations healthfully, in nutrient-dense forms. The remaining calories—around 15 percent—are calories
available for other uses, including for added sugars or saturated fat beyond the small amounts found in nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages within the pattern, to consume more than the recommended amount of a food
group, or for alcoholic beverages. This equates to 250 to 350 remaining calories for calorie patterns appropriate for
most Americans.

The nutrient density and healthfulness of what people eat and drink often is determined
ultimately by how a food item, dish or meal is prepared, at home and away from home, or
produced by a manufacturer. Based on the U.S. food supply and marketplace, the examples of
healthy dietary patterns in this edition are achievable through thoughtful, informed choices one
decision, one meal, one day at a time—and consistently over time.

As such, a nutrient-dense diet, where most nutritional
needs are met by 85% of the calories consumed, offers
a small amount of leeway to add minimal amounts
of added sugars or saturated fat to the diet. For
example, one way to use remaining calories is to add
small amounts of added sugars or saturated fat to
some nutrient-dense foods to help make some foods
more palatable while working towards meeting food
group recommendations—for example, oatmeal with a
small amount of brown sugar or vegetables prepared
with small amounts of butter. However, to achieve a
healthy dietary pattern, all (or mostly all) food group
recommendations should be met with foods and
beverages that are in nutrient-dense forms.
A healthy dietary pattern has little room available for
foods and beverages high in added sugars, saturated
fat, and/or sodium. Intakes of foods and beverages
high in these components should be limited. These
foods and beverages should be occasional choices—
consumed in small portions.
While intakes of added sugars, saturated fat, and
sodium should be limited, the guidance below is
intended to allow programs and individuals to have
some flexibility to choose a healthy dietary pattern
within calorie limits that fits personal preferences and
cultural traditions—and allows day-to-day flexibility

to support a healthy dietary pattern over
time. Additionally, if alcoholic beverages
are consumed, intakes should be within the
limits described in this chapter, and calories should
be accounted for to keep total calorie intake at an
appropriate level.

Added Sugars

A healthy dietary pattern limits added sugars to less
than 10 percent of calories per day. Added sugars
can help with preservation; contribute to functional
attributes such as viscosity, texture, body, color, and
browning capability, and/or help improve the palatability
of some nutrient-dense foods. In fact, the nutrientdense choices included in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern are based on availability in the U.S. food supply
and include 17-50 calories from added sugars, or
1.5-2 percent of total calories.
Foods and beverages high in calories from added sugars
should be limited to help achieve healthy dietary patterns
within calorie limits. When added sugars in foods and
beverages exceed 10 percent of calories, a healthy
dietary pattern within calories limits is very difficult to
achieve. Most Americans have less than 8 percent of
calories available for added sugars, including the added
sugars inherent to a healthy dietary pattern. The limit for
added sugars is based on the following assumptions:

Page 41 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan

Guideline

4

• Most calorie levels have less than 15 percent
of calories remaining after meeting food group
recommendations through nutrient-dense choices.

less than the allotted amount of calories for saturated
fat, 10 percent of added sugars may fit in a healthy
dietary pattern.

• Approximately half of remaining calories are
consumed as saturated fat and half consumed as
added sugars.

Added sugars account on average for almost 270
calories—or more than 13 percent of total calories—per
day in the U.S. population. As shown in Figure 1-10,
the major sources of added sugars in typical U.S. diets
are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts and sweet
snacks, sweetened coffee and tea, and candy. Together,
these food categories make up more than half of the
intake of all added sugars while contributing very little
to food group recommendations.

• Total saturated fat intakes meet the recommendation
for less than 10 percent of total calorie intake.
• No alcoholic beverages are consumed.
• Overall calorie intake does not exceed intake needs to
maintain or achieve a healthy weight.
Based on the assumptions above, an individual who
needs 2,000 calories per day (based on age, sex,
and physical activity level) has less than 7 percent
of calories available for added sugars. Individuals
who need 2,800 calories per day or less have less
than 8 percent of calories available for added sugars.
Individuals who need more than 3,000 calories may
have a total of 9 to 10 percent of calories available for
added sugars. In this portion of the population that
requires high calorie intake, an upper limit of 10 percent
of calories from added sugars may be consumed while
still meeting food group recommendations in nutrientdense forms. The 10 percent added sugar limit allows
for flexibility in food choices over time but also requires
careful planning. For example, if one chooses to eat

Individuals have many potential options for reducing the
intake of added sugars, including reducing the intake
of major sources of added sugars. Strategies include
reducing portions, consuming these items less often,
and selecting options low in added sugars. For those
with a weight loss goal, limiting intake of foods and
beverages high in added sugars is a strategy to help
reduce calorie intake.
It should be noted that replacing added sugars with
low- and no-calorie sweeteners may reduce calorie
intake in the short-term and aid in weight management,
yet questions remain about their effectiveness as a
long-term weight management strategy. For additional
information about high-intensity sweeteners permitted
for use in food in the United States, see fda.gov/food/
food-additives-petitions/high-intensity-sweeteners.

Saturated Fat

For those 2 years and older, intake of saturated fat
should be limited to less than 10 percent of calories per
day by replacing them with unsaturated fats, particularly
polyunsaturated fats. Although some saturated fat is
inherent in foods (e.g., high-fat meat), some sources are
added (e.g., butter on toast). Similar to added sugars,
some of the nutrient-dense choices included in the
Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern include saturated fat.
Approximately 5 percent of total calories inherent to the
nutrient-dense foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern are from saturated fat from sources such as
lean meat, poultry, and eggs; nuts and seeds; grains;
and saturated fatty acids in oils. As such, there is little
room to include additional saturated fat in a healthy
dietary pattern while staying within limits for saturated
fat and total calories.
Current average intakes of saturated fat are 11 percent
of calories. Only 23 percent of individuals consume
amounts of saturated fat consistent with the limit of
less than 10 percent of calories. The main sources
of saturated fat in the U.S. diet include sandwiches,
including burgers, tacos, and burritos; desserts and
sweet snacks; and rice, pasta, and other grain-based
mixed dishes (Figure 1-11). Saturated fat is commonly
found in higher amounts in high-fat meat, full-fat dairy
products (e.g., whole milk, ice cream, cheese), butter,
coconut oil, and palm kernel and palm oil.

Strategies to lower saturated fat intake include reducing
intakes of dessert and sweet snacks by consuming
smaller portion sizes and eating these foods less often.
Additional strategies include reading food labels to
choose packaged foods lower in saturated fats and
choosing lower fat forms of foods and beverages
(e.g., fat-free or low-fat milk instead of 2 percent or
whole milk; lean rather than fatty cuts of meat). When
cooking and purchasing meals, select lean meat and
lower fat cheese in place of high-fat meats and regular
cheese—or replace them with ingredients with oils,
such as nuts, seeds, or avocado. Cook and purchase
products made with oils higher in polyunsaturated and
monounsaturated fat (e.g., canola, corn, olive, peanut,
safflower, soybean, and sunflower) rather than butter,
shortening, or coconut or palm oils.
A note on trans fats and dietary cholesterol: The
National Academies recommends that trans fat
and dietary cholesterol consumption to be as low
as possible without compromising the nutritional
adequacy of the diet. The USDA Dietary Patterns are
limited in trans fats and low in dietary cholesterol.
Cholesterol and a small amount of trans fat occur
naturally in some animal source foods. As of June
2018, partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the major
source of artificial trans fat in the food supply, are no
longer Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). Therefore,
PHOs are no longer added to foods.

Sodium

Sodium is an essential nutrient primarily consumed as
salt (sodium chloride). Healthy eating patterns
limit sodium to the Chronic Disease Risk Reduction
(CDRR) levels defined by the National Academies—
1,200 mg/day for ages 1 through 3; 1,500 mg/day for
ages 4 through 8; 1,800 mg/day for ages 9 through 13;
and 2,300 mg/day for all other age groups. The CDRR for
sodium was established using evidence of the benefit of
reducing sodium intake on cardiovascular risk and
hypertension risk.
As a food ingredient, sodium is used in multiple ways,
including curing meat, baking, as a thickening agent, as a
flavor enhancer, as a preservative, and to retain moisture.
The nutrient-dense choices in the Healthy U.S.-Style
Dietary Pattern provide approximately 60-100 percent of
the age-specific CDRR for sodium across calorie levels
with amounts ranging from about 1,000 to 2,200 mg.
For most calorie levels and at most ages, there is very
little room for food choices that are high in sodium.
Average intakes of sodium are high across the U.S.
population compared to the CDRRs. Average intakes
for those ages 1 and older is 3,393 milligrams per day,
with a range of about 2,000 to 5,000 mg per day. Only a
small proportion of total sodium intake is from sodium
inherent in foods or from salt added in home cooking
or at the table. Most sodium consumed in the United
States comes from salt added during commercial food
processing and preparation, including foods prepared
at restaurants.
Sodium is found in foods from almost all food categories
across the food supply (Figure 1-12), including mixed
dishes such as sandwiches, burgers, and tacos; rice,
pasta, and grain dishes; pizza; meat, poultry, and
seafood dishes; and soups. Calorie intake is highly
associated with sodium intake (i.e., the more foods and
beverages people consume, the more sodium they tend
to consume).
Because sodium is found in so many foods, multiple
strategies should be implemented to reduce sodium
intake to the recommended limits. Careful choices are
needed in all food groups to reduce intake. Strategies
to lower sodium intake include cooking at home more
often; using the Nutrition Facts label to choose products
with less sodium, reduced sodium, or no-salt-added, etc.;
and flavoring foods with herbs and spices instead of salt
based on personal and cultural foodways.

Nutrition Facts Label

The Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods and beverages is a tool for making informed and healthy
food choices. For the first time in more than 20 years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
updated the Nutrition Facts label. There are a number of key changes to the label including:
Along with the updated

Menu Nutrition Labeling

Americans eat and drink about one-third of their
calories from foods prepared away from home.
Usually, these foods provide more calories,
saturated fat, and sodium than meals prepared
at home. To help individuals make informed and
healthy decisions, many food establishments
and chain restaurants list calories in foods
or beverages on menus or menu boards and
additional nutrition information is available
upon request. More information is available at
fda.gov/CaloriesOnTheMenu.

Guideline

Alcoholic Beverages

The Dietary Guidelines does not recommend that
individuals who do not drink alcohol start drinking for any
reason. There are also some people who should not drink
at all, such as if they are pregnant or might be pregnant;
under the legal age for drinking; if they have certain
medical conditions or are taking certain medications that
can interact with alcohol; and if they are recovering from
an alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control
the amount they drink. If adults age 21 years and older
choose to drink alcoholic beverages, drinking less is
better for health than drinking more.
Evidence indicates that, among those who drink, higher
average alcohol consumption is associated with an
increased risk of death from all causes compared with
lower average alcohol consumption. Alcohol misuse
or consuming alcohol in excess of recommendations
increases risk of several other conditions such as liver
disease, cardiovascular disease, injuries, and alcohol
use disorders.
For the purposes of evaluating amounts of alcohol that
may be consumed, the Dietary Guidelines defines drink
equivalents. One alcoholic drink equivalent is defined as
containing 14 grams (0.6 fl oz) of pure alcohol.
The following count as one alcoholic drink equivalent:
12 fluid ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol), 5 fluid
ounces of wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 fluid ounces of
80 proof distilled spirits (40% alcohol). To help Americans
move toward a healthy dietary pattern and minimize
risks associated with drinking, adults of legal drinking
age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation
by limiting intakes to 2 drinks or less in a day for men
and 1 drink or less in a day for women, on days when
alcohol is consumed. This is not intended as an average
over several days, but rather the amount consumed on
any single day. Binge drinking,3 defined as 5 or more
drinks for the typical adult male or 4 or more drinks for
3 More

4

the typical adult female in about 2 hours, should
be avoided. Emerging evidence suggests that
even drinking within the recommended limits
may increase the overall risk of death from various
causes, such as from several types of cancer and some
forms of cardiovascular disease. Alcohol has been
found to increase risk for cancer, and for some types of
cancer, the risk increases even at low levels of alcohol
consumption (less than 1 drink in a day). Caution,
therefore, is recommended.
Alcoholic beverages are not a component of the
USDA Dietary Patterns. The amount of alcohol and
calories in beverages varies and should be accounted
for within the limits of healthy dietary patterns, so
that calorie limits are not exceeded (see “Calories in
Alcoholic Beverages”).

Approximately 60 percent of adults report alcoholic
beverage consumption in the past month. Of those,
approximately 30 percent binge drink, sometimes
multiple times per month. During days when men and
women consume alcohol, their consumption typically
exceeds current guidance. Among adults, including
those who do not drink, alcoholic beverages contribute
approximately 5 percent of calorie intake (3 to 4% of
calories for women and 5 to 7% for men); this translates
into approximately 9 percent of calories among those
who drink. As such, among those who drink, alcoholic
beverages, alone, account for most of the calories that
remain after meeting food group recommendations
in nutrient-dense forms—leaving very few calories for
added sugars or saturated fat.
Adults who choose to drink, and are not among the
individuals listed above who should not drink, are
encouraged to limit daily intakes to align with the Dietary
Guidelines—and to consider calories from alcoholic
beverages so as not to exceed daily calorie limits.

information is available at niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking.

Calories in Alcoholic Beverages

Alcoholic beverages supply calories but few nutrients,
and calories from alcoholic beverages should be
accounted for to keep total calorie intake at an
appropriate level. Alcoholic beverages may contain
calories from both alcohol and other ingredients, such
as soda, juice, and added sugars. It is important to
consider ingredients and portion size. The range of
calories in cocktails varies widely depending on serving
size and ingredients. Examples of calories contained in
alcoholic beverages include:

12 fluid ounces of regular
beer (5% alcohol):
about 150 calories

5 fluid ounces of wine
(12% alcohol):
about 120 calories

1.5 fluid ounces of
80 proof distilled spirits
(40% alcohol): about 100 calories

7 fluid ounces of a
rum (40% alcohol) and
cola: about 190 calories

Support Healthy
Dietary Patterns for
All Americans
Everyone has a role to play to support access to healthy
foods and beverages in multiple settings nationwide
where people live, learn, work, play, and gather. Having
access to healthy, safe, and affordable food is crucial
for an individual to achieve a healthy dietary pattern.
Concerted efforts within communities, businesses
and industries, organizations, government, and other
segments of society are needed to support individuals
and families in making lifestyle choices that align with
the Dietary Guidelines.
Food manufacturers and retail establishments can
support Americans in achieving a healthy dietary
pattern by providing healthy options in all the places
where foods and beverages are purchased. During
the past few decades, food products and menus have
evolved substantially in response to consumer demand
and public health concerns. Food reformulation and
menu and retail modification opportunities include
offering more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat
and fat-free dairy, and a greater variety of protein foods
that are nutrient dense, while also reducing sodium
and added sugars, reducing saturated fat and replacing
it with unsaturated fats, and reducing added refined
starches. Portion sizes also can be reduced to help
individuals make choices that better fit within their
calorie needs. Food manufacturers are encouraged to
consider the entire composition of the food or beverage,
and not just individual nutrients or ingredients when
developing or reformulating products.
Similarly, when developing or modifying menus,
establishments can consider the range of offerings
both within and across food groups and other dietary
components to determine whether the healthy options
offered reflect the proportions in healthy dietary
patterns. In taking these actions, care should be taken
to assess any potential unintended consequences so
that as changes are made to better align with the Dietary
Guidelines, undesirable changes are not introduced. For
example, a change made to reduce the amount of added
sugars in a product should not come at the expense of
increasing the amount of saturated fat or sodium.
Food access is influenced by diverse factors, such as
proximity to food retail outlets (e.g., the number and

4

types of stores in an area), ability to prepare
one’s own meals or eat independently, and the
availability of personal or public transportation.
The underlying socioeconomic characteristics of a
neighborhood also may influence an individual’s ability
to access foods to support healthy eating patterns.

In 2019, 10.5 percent of households were food insecure
at least some time during the year. Food insecurity
occurs when access to nutritionally adequate and
safe food is limited or uncertain. Food insecurity can
be temporary or persist over time, preventing
individuals and families from following a healthy
dietary pattern that aligns with the Dietary Guidelines.
The prevalence of food insecurity typically rises during
times of economic downturn as households experience
greater hardship. Government and nongovernment
nutrition assistance programs help alleviate food
insecurity and play an essential role by providing food,
meals, and educational resources so that participants
can make healthy food choices within their budget.
Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 highlight examples of these
resources at each life stage.
As discussed in subsequent chapters, everyone has
an important role in leading disease prevention efforts
within their organizations and communities to make
healthy eating an organizational and societal norm.
Changes at multiple levels of society are needed, and
these changes, in combination and over time, can
have a meaningful impact on the health of current and
future generations.

Looking Toward
the Life Stages
This chapter has provided guidance about the
fundamentals of a healthy dietary pattern. These
fundamentals are remarkably consistent across life
stages, even though each stage also has its own
specific nutrition considerations. The following chapters
build on this chapter and take a closer look at each of
the life stages: Chapter 2 provides a focused discussion
of the unique nutritional needs of infants and toddlers.
Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 present recommended dietary
patterns, describe current nutrition intakes, and provide
tailored nutrition information specific to children and
adolescents, adults, women who are pregnant or
lactating, and older adults, respectively.

Introduction

Key Recommendations

T

• For about the first 6 months
of life, exclusively feed infants
human milk. Continue to feed
infants human milk through at
least the first year of life, and
longer if desired. Feed infants
iron-fortified infant formula during
the first year of life when human
milk is unavailable.

he time from birth until a child’s
second birthday is a critically
important period for proper growth
and development. It also is key for
establishing healthy dietary patterns
that may influence the trajectory of
eating behaviors and health throughout
the life course. During this period,
nutrients critical for brain development
and growth must be provided in
adequate amounts. Children in this
age group consume small quantities
of foods, so it’s important to make
every bite count!

• Provide infants with supplemental
vitamin D beginning soon
after birth.
• At about 6 months, introduce
infants to nutrient-dense
complementary foods.
• Introduce infants to potentially
allergenic foods along with other
complementary foods.
• Encourage infants and toddlers to
consume a variety of foods from
all food groups. Include foods rich
in iron and zinc, particularly for
infants fed human milk.
• Avoid foods and beverages with
added sugars.
• Limit foods and beverages higher
in sodium.
• As infants wean from human milk
or infant formula, transition to a
healthy dietary pattern.

Page 53 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers

B I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS

Human milk feeding alone is the ideal form of nutrition
from birth through about age 6 months. Human milk
provides necessary nutrients, protective factors against
disease, and other unique immunological benefits. If
human milk is unavailable, infants should be fed an ironfortified commercial infant formula. Once an infant is
developmentally ready, foods and beverages should be
introduced to complement human milk feeding. These
complementary foods and beverages are essential to
meet the nutrient requirements of infants starting at
about age 6 months and should be selected carefully
to help meet these needs. As an infant becomes a
toddler, and learns to eat a variety of foods, flavors, and
textures, the goal of complementary feeding becomes
establishing a healthy dietary pattern and transitioning to
a healthy family diet by age 2.

Putting the Key
Recommendations
Into Action
Feed Infants Human Milk for the First
6 Months, If Possible

Exclusive human milk feeding is one of the best ways to
start an infant off on the path of lifelong healthy nutrition.
Exclusive human milk feeding, commonly referred to as
exclusive breastfeeding, refers to an infant consuming
only human milk, and not in combination with infant
formula and/or complementary foods or beverages
(including water), except for medications or vitamin and
mineral supplementation.
Human milk can support an infant’s nutrient needs for
about the first 6 months of life, with the exception of
vitamin D and potentially iron. In addition to nutrients,
human milk includes bioactive substances and

immunologic properties that support infant health and
growth and development.
U.S. data show that about 84 percent of infants born in
2017 were ever fed human milk, with only 25 percent fed
human milk exclusively through age 6 months, and 35
percent continuing to be fed any human milk at age 12
months. Nearly one-quarter of infants were fed some
human milk beyond age 12 months, with about 15 percent
of toddlers being fed human milk at age 18 months.
Families may have a number of reasons for not having
human milk for their infant. For example, a family may
choose not to breastfeed, a child may be adopted, or the
mother may be unable to produce a full milk supply or
may be unable to pump and store milk safely due to family
or workplace pressures. If human milk is unavailable,
infants should be fed an iron-fortified commercial infant
formula (i.e., labeled “with iron”) regulated by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is based on
standards that ensure nutrient content and safety. Infant
formulas are designed to meet the nutritional needs of
infants and are not needed beyond age 12 months. It is
important to take precautions to ensure that expressed
human milk and prepared infant formula are handled
and stored safely (see “Proper Handling and Storage of
Human Milk and Infant Formula”).

Donor Human Milk

If families do not have sufficient human milk for their infant but want to feed their infant human
milk, they may look for alternative ways to obtain it. It is important for the family to obtain
pasteurized donor human milk from a source, such as an accredited human milk bank, that has
screened its donors and taken appropriate safety precautions. When human milk is obtained
directly from individuals or through the internet, the donor is unlikely to have been screened for
infectious diseases, and it is unknown whether the human milk has been collected or stored in
a way to reduce possible safety risks to the baby. More information is available at fda.gov/science-research/
pediatrics/use-donor-human-milk.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers | Page 54

B IRTH TH ROUGH 2 3 M O NT HS

Proper Handling and Storage of Human Milk and
Infant Formula
• Wash hands thoroughly before expressing human milk or preparing to feed
human milk or infant formula.
• If expressing human milk, ensure pump parts are thoroughly cleaned
before use.
• If preparing powdered infant formula, use a safe water source and follow
instructions on the label.
• Refrigerate freshly expressed human milk within 4 hours for up to 4 days.
Previously frozen and thawed human milk should be used within 24 hours.
Thawed human milk should never be refrozen. Refrigerate prepared infant
formula for up to 24 hours.
• Do not use a microwave to warm human milk or infant formula. Warm safely
by placing the sealed container of human milk or infant formula in a bowl of
warm water or under warm, running tap water.
• Once it has been offered to the infant, use or discard leftovers quickly (within
2 hours for human milk or 1 hour for infant formula).
• Thoroughly wash all infant feeding items, such as bottles and nipples.
Consider sanitizing feeding items for infants younger than 3 months of age,
infants born prematurely, or infants with a compromised immune system.

B I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS

Homemade infant formulas and those that are improperly and illegally
imported into the United States without mandated FDA review and
supervision should not be used. Toddler milks or toddler formulas
should not be fed to infants, as they are not designed to meet the
nutritional needs of infants.

Provide Infants Supplemental Vitamin D Beginning
Soon After Birth

All infants who are fed human milk exclusively or who receive both
human milk and infant formula (mixed fed) will need a vitamin D
supplement of 400 IU per day beginning soon after birth. Infant formula
is fortified with vitamin D, thus, when an infant is receiving full feeds
of infant formula, vitamin D supplementation is not needed. Families
who do not wish to provide a supplement directly to their infant should
discuss with a healthcare provider the risks and benefits of maternal
high dose supplementation options. Even when consuming a varied
diet, achieving adequate vitamin D from foods and beverages (natural
sources) alone is challenging, suggesting that young children may
need to continue taking a vitamin D supplement after age 12 months.
Parents, caregivers, and guardians should consult with a healthcare
provider to determine how long supplementation is necessary.

Introduce Infants To Nutrient-Dense Complementary
Foods at About 6 Months Old

Supplemental Vitamin B12

Human milk has sufficient vitamin
B12 to meet infant needs unless
the mother’s vitamin B12 status
is inadequate. This can occur for
different reasons, including when
the mother eats a strictly vegan
diet without any animal source
foods. When the mother is at risk
of vitamin B12 deficiency, human
milk may not provide sufficient
vitamin B12. In these cases, the
mother and/or infant fed human
milk may require a vitamin B12
supplement. Parents, caregivers,
and guardians should consult with
a healthcare provider to determine
whether supplementation is
necessary.

At about age 6 months, infants should be introduced to nutrient-dense,
developmentally appropriate foods to complement human milk or
infant formula feedings. Some infants may show developmental signs
of readiness before age 6 months (see “Developmental Readiness for
Beginning to Eat Solid Foods”), but introducing complementary foods
before age 4 months is not recommended. Waiting until after age 6
months to introduce foods also is not recommended. Starting around
that time, complementary foods are necessary to ensure adequate
nutrition and exposure to flavors, textures, and different types of foods.
Infants should be given age- and developmentally appropriate foods to
help prevent choking. It is important to introduce potentially allergenic
foods along with other complementary foods. For infants fed human
milk, it is particularly important to include complementary foods that
are rich in iron and zinc when starting complementary foods (see
Appendix 1: Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups).
About one-third (32%) of infants in the United States are introduced
to complementary foods and beverages before age 4 months,
highlighting the importance of providing guidance and support to
parents, guardians, and caregivers on the timing of introduction to
complementary foods. Early introduction of complementary foods and
beverages is higher among infants receiving infant formula (42%) or
a combination of infant formula and human milk (32%) than among
infants exclusively fed human milk (19%).

Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers | Page 56

B IRTH TH ROUGH 2 3 M O NT HS

Developmental Readiness for Beginning To
Eat Solid Foods

The age at which infants reach different developmental
stages will vary. Typically between age 4 and 6 months,
infants develop the gross motor, oral, and fine motor skills
necessary to begin to eat complementary foods. As an
infant’s oral skills develop, the thickness and texture of
foods can gradually be varied. Signs that an infant is ready
for complementary foods include:
• Being able to control head and neck.
• Sitting up alone or with support.
• Bringing objects to the mouth.
• Trying to grasp small objects, such as toys or food.
• Swallowing food rather than pushing it back out
onto the chin.
Infants and young children should be given age- and
developmentally appropriate foods to help prevent
choking. Foods such as hot dogs, candy, nuts and
seeds, raw carrots, grapes, popcorn, and chunks of
peanut butter are some of the foods that can be a choking
risk for young children. Parents, guardians, and caregivers
are encouraged to take steps to decrease choking
risks, including:
• Offering foods in the appropriate size, consistency, and
shape that will allow an infant or young child to eat and
swallow easily.
• Making sure the infant or young child is sitting up
in a high chair or other safe, supervised place.
• Ensuring an adult is supervising feeding
during mealtimes.
• Not putting infant cereal or other solid foods in an
infant’s bottle. This could increase the risk of choking
and will not make the infant sleep longer.
More information on foods that can present choking
hazards is available from USDA at wicworks.fns.

Introduce Infants to Potentially Allergenic Foods
Along With Other Complementary Foods

Potentially allergenic foods (e.g., peanuts, egg, cow milk products,
tree nuts, wheat, crustacean shellfish, fish, and soy) should be
introduced when other complementary foods are introduced to an
infant’s diet. Introducing peanut-containing foods in the first year
reduces the risk that an infant will develop a food allergy to peanuts.
Cow milk, as a beverage, should be introduced at age 12 months
or later (see “Establish a Healthy Beverage Pattern”). There is no
evidence that delaying introduction of allergenic foods, beyond
when other complementary foods are introduced, helps to prevent
food allergy. For more information, see “For Infants at High Risk
of Peanut Allergy, Introduce Peanut-Containing Foods at Age
4 to 6 Months.”

For Infants at High Risk of
Peanut Allergy, Introduce
Peanut-Containing Foods
at Age 4 to 6 Months
If an infant has severe eczema,
egg allergy, or both (conditions
that increase the risk of peanut
allergy), age-appropriate, peanutcontaining foods should be
introduced into the diet as early
as age 4 to 6 months. This will
reduce the risk of developing
peanut allergy.

Caregivers should check with
the infant’s healthcare provider
before feeding the infant peanutcontaining foods. A blood test
or skin prick may be
recommended to determine
whether peanut should be
introduced to the infant, and, if
so, the safest way to introduce it.

Prevention of Peanut Allergy in the

Encourage Infants and Toddlers To
Consume a Variety of Complementary
Foods and Beverages To Meet Energy and
Nutrient Needs

Parents, caregivers, and guardians are encouraged
to introduce foods across all the food groups—as
described below and carrying forward the principles
in Chapter 1—including items that fit within a
family’s preferences, cultural traditions, and budget.
Complementary foods and beverages should be rich in
nutrients, meet calorie and nutrient requirements during
this critical period of growth and development, and
stay within limits of dietary components such as added
sugars and sodium. Although the Dietary Guidelines does
not provide a recommended dietary pattern for infants
ages 6 through 11 months, infants should be on the
path to a healthy dietary pattern that is recommended
for those ages 12 through 23 months (see Appendix 3:
USDA Dietary Patterns).
In the United States, some dietary components are
of public health concern for infants and toddlers. Iron
is a dietary component of public health concern for
underconsumption among older infants ages 6 through
11 months who are fed primarily human milk and
consume inadequate iron from complementary foods.
Older infants who are fed primarily human milk also
underconsume zinc and protein from complementary
foods, and vitamin D, choline, and potassium are notably
underconsumed by all older infants. During the second
year of life, the dietary components of public health
concern for underconsumption are vitamin D, calcium,
dietary fiber, and potassium and for overconsumption
are added sugars and sodium. Lists of dietary sources of

iron, calcium, potassium, dietary fiber, and vitamin D are
available at DietaryGuidelines.gov.
INTRODUCE IRON-RICH FOODS TO INFANTS
STARTING AT ABOUT 6 MONTHS OLD
Iron-rich foods (e.g., meats and seafood rich in heme
iron and iron-fortified infant cereals) are important
components of the infant’s diet from age 6 through
11 months to maintain adequate iron status, which
supports neurologic development and immune function.
Infants are typically born with body stores of iron
adequate for about the first 6 months of life, depending
on gestational age, maternal iron status, and timing of
umbilical cord clamping. By age 6 months, however,
infants require an external source of iron apart from
human milk.
Caregivers of infants exclusively fed human milk should
talk with their pediatric care provider about whether
there may be a need for infants supplementation with
iron before age 6 months. A complementary food source
of iron beginning at about 6 months is particularly
important for infants fed human milk because the iron
content of human milk is low and maternal iron intake
during lactation does not increase its content. In the
United States, an estimated 77 percent of infants fed
human milk have inadequate iron intake during the
second half of infancy, highlighting the importance of
introducing iron-rich foods starting at age 6 months.
Infants receiving most of their milk feeds as ironfortified infant formula are likely to need less iron from
complementary foods beginning at 6 months of age. After

B I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS

age 12 months, children have a lower iron requirement,
but good food sources of iron are still needed to maintain
adequate iron status and prevent deficiency.
INTRODUCE ZINC-RICH FOODS TO INFANTS
STARTING AT ABOUT 6 MONTHS OLD
Zinc-rich complementary foods (e.g., meats, beans, zincfortified infant cereals) are important from age 6 months
onwards to support adequate zinc status, which supports
growth and immune function. Although the zinc content
of human milk is initially high and efficiently absorbed, the
concentration declines over the first 6 months of lactation
and is not affected by maternal zinc intake. During the
second half of infancy, approximately half (54%) of U.S.
infants fed human milk have inadequate zinc intake.
Prioritizing zinc-rich foods starting at 6 months of age to
complement human milk feedings will help infants meet
their requirement for zinc.
ENCOURAGE A VARIETY OF FOODS FROM ALL
FOOD GROUPS TO INFANTS STARTING AT ABOUT
6 MONTHS OLD
To support nutrient adequacy, foster acceptance of
healthy foods, and set intakes on a path toward a healthy
pattern, it is important to encourage foods from all food
groups. Because very young children are being exposed
to new textures and flavors for the first time, it may take
up to 8 to 10 exposures for an infant to accept a new type
of food. Repeated offering of foods such as fruits and
vegetables increases the likelihood of an infant accepting
them. A nutrient-dense, diverse diet from age 6 through
23 months of life includes a variety of food sources from
each food group.
• Protein foods, including meats, poultry, eggs,
seafood, nuts, seeds, and soy products, are important
sources of iron, zinc, protein, choline, and long
chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The long-chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically the essential
omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids supplied through
seafood, nuts, seeds, and oils, influence the infant’s
fatty acid status and are among the key nutrients
needed for the rapid brain development that occurs
through the infant’s first 2 years of life. Some types of
fish such as salmon and trout are also natural sources
of vitamin D. To limit exposure to methylmercury from
seafood, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued joint
guidance regarding the types of seafood to choose.1

• Vegetables and fruits, especially those rich in
potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C, should be offered
to infants and toddlers age 6 through 23 months. The
vegetable subgroup of beans, peas, and lentils also
provides a good source of protein and dietary fiber.
• For dairy, families can introduce yogurt and cheese,
including soy-based yogurt, before 12 months.
However, infants should not consume cow milk, as
a beverage, or fortified soy beverage, before age 12
months as a replacement for human milk or infant
formula (see “Cow Milk and Fortified Soy Beverages”).
In the second year of life, when calcium requirements
increase, dairy products, including milk, yogurt,
cheese, and fortified soy beverages and soy yogurt
provide a good source of calcium. Vitamin D-fortified
milk and soy beverages also provide a good source of
vitamin D. For those younger than the age of 2, offer
dairy products without added sugar (see “Avoid
Added Sugars”).
• Grains, including iron-fortified infant cereal, play an
important role in meeting nutrient needs during this
life stage. Infant cereals fortified with iron include oat,
barley, multigrain, and rice cereals. Rice cereal fortified
with iron is a good source of nutrients for infants, but
rice cereal shouldn’t be the only type of cereal given
to infants. Offering young children whole grains more
often than refined grains will increase dietary fiber as
well as potassium intake during the second year
of life and help young children establish healthy
dietary practices.

DIETARY COMPONENTS TO LIMIT
While encouraging intake from each food group, some dietary
components should be limited.
Avoid Added Sugars
Infants and young children have virtually no room in their diet for
added sugars. This is because the nutrient requirements for infants
and young children are quite high relative to their size, but the amount
of complementary foods they consume is small. Complementary
foods need to be nutrient-dense and not contain additional calories
from added sugars. In addition, low- and no-calorie sweeteners, which
can also be called high-intensity sweeteners, are not recommended
for children younger than age 2. Taste preferences are being formed
during this time period, and infants and young children may develop
preferences for overly sweet foods if introduced to very sweet foods
during this timeframe. For more information on added sugars,
see Chapter 1.
Avoid Foods Higher in Sodium
Sodium is found in a number of foods, including some salty snacks,
commercial toddler foods, and processed meats. In addition to
keeping sodium intake within limits for toddlers (see Appendix 1),
another reason to avoid high-sodium foods is that taste preferences
for salty food may be established early in life. Choose fresh or
low-sodium frozen foods, when available, and low-sodium canned
foods to minimize sodium content. For more information on sodium,
see Chapter 1.
Avoid Honey and Unpasteurized Foods and Beverages
Infants should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked
honey. Honey can contain the Clostridium botulinum organism that
could cause serious illness or death among infants. Infants and
young children also should not be given any unpasteurized foods or
beverages, such as unpasteurized juices, milk, yogurt, or cheeses, as
they could contain harmful bacteria.

Establish a Healthy Beverage Pattern

An important part of establishing an overall healthy dietary pattern is
careful consideration of beverages. Guidance for different beverage
categories is provided below.
WATER
For healthy infants with adequate intake of human milk or infant
formula, supplemental water is typically not needed in the first
6 months. Small amounts (up to 4 to 8 ounces per day) of plain,
fluoridated drinking water can be given to infants with the introduction
of complementary foods. Plain, fluoridated drinking water intake
can slowly be increased after age 1 to meet hydration and
fluoride needs.

Page 61 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers

B I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS

COW MILK AND FORTIFIED SOY BEVERAGES
Infants should not consume cow milk or fortified soy
beverages before age 12 months to replace human milk
or infant formula. Cow milk does not have the correct
amount of nutrients for infants, and its higher protein
and mineral content are hard for an infant’s kidneys
and digestive system to process. Plain cow milk (whole
milk) or fortified unsweetened soy beverage can be
offered beginning around 12 months of age to help
meet calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein needs.
Flavored milks for children age 12 through 23 months
should be avoided because they contain added sugars.
PLANT-BASED MILK ALTERNATIVES
Plant-based milk alternatives, which are sometimes
referred to as milk alternatives, include beverages made
from plants, such as soy, oat, rice, coconut, and almond.
These beverages should not be used in the first year of
life to replace human milk or infant formula. They may
come in different flavors and some forms have added
sugars. Unsweetened versions of these beverages may
be accommodated in small amounts in the diet during
the second year of life, but most have significantly
less protein than cow milk and are not always fortified
with calcium and vitamin D. Among plant-based milk
alternatives, only fortified soy beverage is currently
considered a dairy equivalent. Thus, consuming other
plant-based beverages does not contribute to meeting
dairy recommendations.

SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES

Before age 12 months, 100% fruit or vegetable juices
should not be given to infants. In the second year of
life, fruit juice is not necessary, and most fruit intake
should come from eating whole fruit. If 100% fruit juice
is provided, up to 4 ounces per day can fit in a healthy
dietary pattern. Juices that contain added sugars should
be avoided.

Sugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., regular soda, juice
drinks [not 100% fruit juice], sports drinks, and flavored
water with sugar) should not be given to children
younger than age 2. Drinks labeled as fruit drinks or
fruit-flavored drinks are not the same as 100% fruit juice
and contain added sugars. These beverages displace
nutrient-dense beverages and foods in the diet of young
children. Infants and toddlers do not have room in their
diets for the additional calories from added sugars
found in these beverages. In addition, sugar-sweetened
beverage intake in infancy and early childhood may
predispose children to consume more of these
beverages later in life.

TODDLER MILK AND TODDLER DRINKS

CAFFEINATED BEVERAGES

There are no clear needs for toddler milks or drinks.
Needed nutrients can be obtained from cow milk
or fortified soy beverage and appropriate solid
foods. Toddler milks and toddler drinks are drinks
supplemented with nutrients, and typically contain added
sugars. A variety of nutrient-dense complementary
foods and beverages without added sugars should be
emphasized for achieving nutrient recommendations.

Concerns exist about potential negative health effects of
caffeine for young children, and no safe limits of caffeine
have been established for this age group. Caffeine
is a stimulant that can occur naturally in foods and
beverages or as an additive. Major sources of caffeine
for Americans include beverages such as soft drinks, tea,
coffee, and sports drinks. Beverages containing caffeine
should be avoided for children younger than age 2.

Healthy Dietary
Pattern During a
Toddler’s Second
Year of Life
In the second year of life, toddlers consume less
human milk, and infant formula is not recommended.
Calories and nutrients should predominantly be met
from a healthy dietary pattern of age-appropriate foods
and beverages. The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern
presented here is intended for toddlers ages 12 through
23 months who no longer consume human milk or
infant formula. The pattern represents the types and
amounts of foods needed to meet energy and nutrition
requirements for this period (Table 2-1). For toddlers who
are still consuming human milk (approximately one-third
at 12 months and 15 percent at 18 months), a healthy
dietary pattern should include a similar combination of
nutrient-dense complementary foods and beverages.
Table 2-1 displays the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits
for food groups and other dietary components that
make up healthy dietary patterns. The pattern is
provided at calorie levels ranging from 700 to 1,000
calories per day, which are appropriate for most
toddlers ages 12 through 23 months (see Appendix 2.
Estimated Calorie Needs). A healthy dietary

pattern includes a variety of nutrient-dense fruits,
vegetables, grains, protein foods (including lean
meats, poultry, eggs, seafood, nuts, and seeds), dairy
(including milk, yogurt, and cheese), and oils. Based on
FDA and EPA’s joint “Advice About Eating Fish,” young
children should eat seafood lowest in methylmercury,
and certain species of seafood should be avoided.2 If
young children are lower in body weight, they should eat
less seafood than the amounts in the Healthy U.S.-Style
Dietary Pattern. More information is available on the FDA
or EPA websites at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/
fishadvice.
After food group and subgroup recommendations are
met, a small number of calories are allocated to oils.
The recommendation to limit saturated fat to less than
10 percent of calories per day does not apply to those
younger than age 2, and the inclusion of higher fat
versions of dairy is a notable difference in the pattern
for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months compared
to patterns for ages 2 and older. However, no calories
remain in the pattern for additional saturated fat or
for added sugars. To illustrate the concept of nutrient
density, Figure 2-1 shows examples of foods and
beverages appropriate for this life stage in forms
that are not in nutrient-dense forms compared to those
that are in nutrient-dense forms. This dietary pattern
requires careful choices of foods and beverages but
does not require inclusion of fortified products
specifically formulated for infants or toddlers to meet
nutrient recommendations.

Figure 2-1
Make Healthy Shifts To Empower Toddlers To Eat Nutrient-Dense Foods in Dietary Patterns
Science shows that early food preferences influence later food choices. Make the first choice the healthiest choices
that set the toddlers on a path of making nutrient-dense choices in the years to come. Examples of shifts in common
choices to healthier, more nutrient-dense food choices include:

Cereal with Added
Sugars

Cereal with Minimal

2 If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list in the FDA/EPA joint “Advice About
Eating Fish,” available at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties
from the “Best Choices” list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g., flounder), salmon, tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters, sardines,
squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting, clams, shad, and Atlantic mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, many commonly
consumed varieties of seafood should be avoided because they cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per week by children without the potential of exceeding safe
methylmercury limits; examples that should not be consumed include: canned light tuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. For a complete list please

Protein foods intakes fall within recommended range,
on average. Intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs make
up a majority of protein foods intakes, however seafood
intakes in this age group is low. Children in this age
group can reduce sodium intake by eating less cured or
processed meats including hot dogs, deli meats,
and sausages.
Due to the relatively high nutrient needs of toddlers, a
healthy dietary pattern has virtually no room for added
sugars. Toddlers consume an average of more than 100
calories from added sugars each day, ranging from 40 to
250 calories a day (about 2.5 to 16 teaspoons). Sugarsweetened beverages, particularly fruit drinks, contribute
more than 25 percent of total added sugars intakes and
sweet bakery products contribute about 15 percent.
Other food category sources contribute a smaller
proportion of total added sugars on their own, but the
wide variety of sources, which include yogurts, ready-toeat cereals, candy, fruits, flavored milk, milk substitutes,
baby food products, and breads, points to the need to
make careful choices across all foods.

Vegetarian Dietary Pattern During the Second Year of Life

A Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern for young children ages 12 through 23 months who
are not fed human milk or infant formula is included in Appendix 3. This pattern describes
a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet that includes regular consumption of eggs, dairy products, soy
products, and nuts or seeds, in addition to vegetables including beans, peas, and lentils, fruits,
grains, and oils. Iron may be of particular concern because plant source foods contain only
non-heme iron, which is less bioavailable than is heme iron. Food source lists for both heme and non-heme
iron are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Vitamin B12 also may be of concern because it is present only in
animal source foods. When feeding infants and toddlers a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, parents, caregivers, and
guardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation of iron, vitamin
B12, and/or other nutrients is necessary and if so, appropriate levels to meet their unique needs.

Supporting Healthy Eating
Parents, guardians, and caregivers play an important role in nutrition during this life stage because infants and
toddlers are fully reliant on them for their needs. In addition to “what” to feed children, “how” to feed young children
also is critical. As noted above, repeated exposure to foods can increase acceptance of new foods. Another
important concept is responsive feeding, a feeding style that emphasizes recognizing and responding to the hunger
or fullness cues of an infant or young child (see “Responsive Feeding”).

Responsive Feeding

Responsive feeding is a term
used to describe a feeding style
that emphasizes recognizing
and responding to the hunger or
fullness cues of an infant or young
child. Responsive feeding helps
young children learn how to selfregulate their intake.
See Table 2-2 for some examples
of signs a child may show for
hunger and fullness when he or
she is a newborn through age 5
months, and signs a child may
start to show between age 6
through 23 months.

Table 2-2
Signs a Child is Hungry or Full
Birth Through Age 5 Months
A child may be hungry if he or she:
• Puts hands to mouth.
• Turns head toward breast or bottle.
• Puckers, smacks, or licks lips.
• Has clenched hands.

A child may be full if he or she:
• Closes mouth.
• Turns head away from breast or bottle.
• Relaxes hands.

Age 6 Through 23 Months
A child may be hungry if he or she:
• Reaches for or points to food.
• Opens his or her mouth when offered a
spoon or food.
• Gets excited when he or she sees food.
• Uses hand motions or makes sounds to
let you know he or she is still hungry.

A child may be full if he or she:
• Pushes food away.
• Closes his or her mouth when food is
offered.
• Turns his or her head away from food.
• Uses hand motions or makes sounds to
let you know he or she is still full.

It is important to listen to the
child’s hunger and fullness cues
to build healthy eating habits during this critical age. If parents, guardians, or caregivers have questions or concerns, a
conversation with a healthcare provider will be helpful.
For more information on signs a child is hungry or full, see: cdc.gov/nutritioninfantandtoddlernutrition/mealtime/

Accessing a Healthy Dietary Pattern

Many resources exist to support healthy growth and development during
infancy and toddlerhood. These include the following Government programs
that aim to support a healthy dietary pattern for infants and toddlers living in
households with limited incomes:
• The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) supports infant and early childhood nutrition through
supplementing the diets of women who are pregnant or lactating and by
providing breastfeeding support and iron-fortified infant formula when
human milk is unavailable or fed only partially. WIC accommodates
the transition to solid foods by providing nutrient-dense foods in the
supplemental food packages offered to older infants and toddlers. Nutrition
education and counseling and referrals to healthcare and social services are
other important resources offered to income-eligible WIC participants.
• The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides reimbursement
for nutrient-dense meals and snacks served to infants and toddlers in
participating child care centers, including at Head Start programs, and day
care homes where infants and toddlers also have access to health
screenings and families can be connected to health services to support their
overall well-being.
• The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest
food assistance program in the United States. SNAP helps meet the
nutritional needs of infants and toddlers living in low-income households by
providing temporary monthly benefits that can be used to access a healthy
dietary pattern.
These Government nutrition programs are especially important for the
14 percent3 of families with children who experience food insecurity and may
struggle to access the foods needed to support a healthy dietary pattern.
Professionals can use these, and additional Government and non-Government
resources that exist within communities, to support healthy eating during
infancy and toddlerhood.

Looking Toward Chapter 3:
Children and Adolescents
This chapter focused on nutrition issues important to infants and toddlers—
exclusive human milk feeding, if possible; introducing nutrient-dense
complementary foods at about age 6 months; and encouraging infants
and toddlers to sample and consume a variety of nutrient-dense foods and
beverages to meet their needs. As toddlers grow and their dietary patterns
become more integrated with the family’s food patterns, new issues arise.
These issues, and how to accommodate them within a lifelong healthy
dietary pattern, are discussed in the next chapter, which focuses on children
and adolescents.

chronic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease) later in life.
Changing this trajectory is crucial because
dietary patterns established during this life
stage tend to continue into adult years.

Healthy eating throughout this life stage involves the child or adolescent,
families and caregivers, and institutions and settings where food is provided
and consumed. Young children are fully reliant on others to provide their
meals and snacks. As children transition to school-age and through
adolescence, they are exposed to new food choices and begin to have
more autonomy in the foods that are selected. New influences on eating
behavior also emerge, such as peer pressure, which can create opportunities
or challenges for establishing dietary patterns consistent with health and
longevity. Adolescents acquire ever-greater independence in their food
choices as they mature, with more time spent on their own with peers
and more foods and beverages frequently consumed in social settings.
Other factors that influence eating behavior include social supports,
exposure to food marketing and promotion, and policies that determine
community design.
Youth have diverse calorie and nutrient needs based on age and patterns
of growth, development, and physical activity. Current intake data of
young children show some components of a healthy dietary pattern that
continue from the infant and toddler life stages. Before these components
of a healthy dietary pattern are established, however, diet quality worsens
through childhood and into adolescence and intake patterns drift further
from recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines. Active community support
is needed to help youth meet food group and nutrient goals with nutrientdense foods and beverages.

Childhood Overweight and Obesity

In the United States, 41 percent of children and adolescents are overweight or have obesity, and the prevalence
is higher among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents as compared to non-Hispanic Asians
and Whites. Overweight and obesity put youth at high risk of serious health concerns. Youth with obesity are
more likely to have immediate health risks, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and impaired glucose
tolerance. They also are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes beginning as soon as the
teenage years and into adulthood. Psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression) and social concerns (e.g., bullying,
stigma) also are more likely in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity.
The causes of childhood obesity are complex and interconnected. Behaviors (e.g., eating habits, level of physical
activity, sedentary time) and the community in which a child or adolescent resides can influence risk of obesity.
Genetics and the fetal environment also play a role in the development of obesity. However, many opportunities
exist to help prevent or manage overweight and obesity as children transition through these life stages. The goal
for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity is to reduce the rate of weight gain while allowing normal
growth and development. This can primarily be done by emphasizing nutrient-dense food and beverage choices,
minimizing calories from sources that do not contribute to a healthy dietary pattern, and encouraging regular
physical activity.

Healthy Dietary
Patterns
Children and adolescents are encouraged to follow the
recommendations on the types of foods and beverages
that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in
Chapter 1. Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan:
The Guidelines and Key Recommendations. Tables 3-1
to 3-3 display the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern to
illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups
and other dietary components that make up healthy
dietary patterns at the calorie levels appropriate for most
children and adolescents across four age ranges: one
table combining patterns relevant for ages 2 through
4 and ages 5 through 8, and single tables for ages 9
through 13 and for ages 14 through 18. Tables 3-1 to
3-3 also show the calories remaining for other uses—
about 10-15 percent of the total available—after meeting
food group and nutrient goals through the selection of
nutrient-dense foods and beverages.
Calorie needs generally increase throughout this life
stage to support growth and development. Child and
adolescent females generally have lower calorie needs

than do males, with variations based on size and level of
physical activity. During adolescence, the range of calorie
intakes widens to support diverse growth trajectories.
More information on the calorie estimates is provided in
Tables 3-1 to 3-3 (see footnote a) and in Appendix 2.
Estimated Calorie Needs.
The USDA Dietary Patterns, including the Healthy
U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, provide a framework
to help children and adolescents follow a healthy
dietary pattern and meet the Guidelines and their
Key Recommendations. The USDA Foods Patterns
can be customized based on dietary needs, personal
preferences, and budgetary constraints. A variety of
nutrient-dense foods and beverages can be selected
across the food group and subgroups as part of an
overall healthy dietary pattern. For more information
about the USDA Food Patterns, see Chapter 1 and
Appendix 3. USDA Dietary Patterns. For this age group,
as for all the others, a figure comparing current intakes to
recommendations is presented. See “Current Intakes” for
more information.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents | Page 72

AGES 2-18

Children Ages 2 Through 8

In early childhood (ages 2 through 4), females require about 1,000 to 1,400 calories per day and males require
about 1,000 to 1,600 calories per day. With the transition to school-age (ages 5 through 8), females require
about 1,200 to 1,800 calories per day and males require about 1,200 to 2,000 calories per day.

Physical Activity

Childhood and adolescence is a critical period for developing movement
skills, learning healthy habits, and establishing a firm foundation for lifelong
health and well-being. For youth, regular physical activity can improve bone
health, cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and cognition (including
academic achievement), and reduce the symptoms of depression.
Preschool-aged children should be active throughout the day to enhance
growth and development. Adults caring for children during this age
should encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types (light,
moderate, or vigorous intensity) and aim for at least 3 hours per day.
School-aged children and adolescents need at least 60 minutes of moderateto-vigorous activity daily to attain the most health benefits from physical
activity. Most activity can be aerobic, like walking, running, or anything that
makes their heart beat faster. They also need muscle-strengthening and
bone-strengthening activities that make their muscles and bones strong, like
climbing on playground equipment, playing basketball, and jumping rope.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans and related Move Your Way® resources have more
information about the benefits of physical activity and tips on how to get
started. Available at health.gov/paguidelines.

Nutrient-Dense Foods
and Beverages

Nutrient-dense foods and
beverages provide vitamins,
minerals, and other healthpromoting components and
have little added sugars,
saturated fat, and sodium.
Vegetables, fruits, whole grains,
seafood, eggs, beans, peas,
and lentils, unsalted nuts and
seeds, fat-free and low-fat dairy
products, and lean meats and
poultry—when prepared with no
or little added sugars, saturated
fat, and sodium—are nutrientdense foods.

Appendix 3.

c The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide joint advice regarding
seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for children.
Depending on body weight, some children should choose seafood
lowest in methylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts in the
Healthy US-Style Dietary Pattern. More information is available on the
FDA and EPA websites at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.
d

If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should
only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list in the FDA/
EPA joint “Advice About Eating Fish,” available at FDA.gov/fishadvice
and EPA.gov/fishadvice. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood
per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best

Choices” list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g.,
flounder), salmon, tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters,
sardines, squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting,
clams, shad, and Atlantic mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of
seafood per week, many commonly consumed varieties of seafood
should be avoided because they cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per
week by children without the potential of exceeding safe methylmercury
limits; examples that should not be consumed include: canned light
tuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. For a
complete list please see: FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.
e Foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or low-fat; and
prepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches, saturated fat,
or sodium. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations
are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within
the overall limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The
number of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and
the amounts of food from each food group required to meet nutritional
goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars
and/or saturated fat, or to eat more than the recommended amount of
food in a food group.

NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines
limits for added sugars and saturated fat; be within the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total
fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded. See Appendix 3
for all calorie levels of the pattern.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents | Page 74

AGES 2-18

Current Intakes
Figures 3-2 to 3-9 highlight the dietary intakes of
children and adolescents, including the Healthy Eating
Index-2015 score, which is an overall measure of how
intakes align with the Dietary Guidelines, as well as
information on the components of a healthy diet—
specifically, the food groups. Figures 3-1, 3-3, 3-5,
and 3-7 display the average intakes of the food groups
compared to the range of recommended intakes at the
calorie levels most relevant to males and females in
these age groups. Additionally, the percent of children
and adolescents exceeding the recommended limits
for added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium are shown,
along with average intakes of these components.
Average intakes compared to recommended intake
ranges of the subgroups for grains are represented in
daily amounts; subgroups for vegetables and protein
foods are represented in weekly amounts (see Figures
3-2, 3-4, 3-6, and 3-8).
Current intakes show that from an early age, dietary
patterns are not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines.
The Healthy Eating Index score of 61 out of 100 for
children ages 2 through 4 indicates that overall diet

quality is poor. Notably, HEI Scores decline throughout
childhood and adolescence, with scores for adolescents
approximately 10 points lower than those for young
children (Figure 3-1).
Among children ages 2 through 4, consumption of
total fruit is generally adequate for about 60 percent
of children. Compared to other age groups, a higher
percentage of young children also have intakes of
total vegetables at or above recommended levels.
The difference between recommended and actual
intakes of total fruit and total vegetables emerges and
expands as children age. By late adolescence, average
fruit and vegetable consumption is about half of the
recommended range of intake. Throughout youth,
starchy vegetables (e.g., white potatoes, corn)—often in
forms that are fried or prepared with additions such as
butter and salt—are more frequently consumed than the
red and orange; dark green; or beans, peas, and lentils
vegetable subgroups. For fruit, about 70 percent of
intake comes from whole forms—fresh, canned, frozen,
or dried—and 100% juice, which are often nutrient-dense
forms. Some fruit is consumed through sources that are
not nutrient-dense; for example, fruit as part of a baked
dessert or juice drink.

AG ES 2 -18

The amount of dairy foods consumed by children and
adolescents is relatively stable across age groups.
Beginning at age 9 the amount of dairy foods in a
healthy dietary pattern increases from 2 ½ to 3 cup
equivalents per day to support an increase in calcium
intake that is needed during these life stages. As a
result, average intake of dairy foods is close to or at
recommended levels for children younger than age
9 while consumption among adolescents is typically
below recommended intake levels.
Although the gaps between recommended and current
intakes widen throughout these life stages for some
dietary components, others, principally whole grains
and seafood, are infrequently consumed by any youth.
Whole grains are consumed below recommended levels
even by young children. As the difference between
recommended and current intakes widens across age
groups, the types of refined and whole-grain foods
consumed remains consistent. Mixed dishes, such as
pizza, pasta, sandwiches, burgers, and tacos, contribute
about 50 percent of total grains intake, and snacks and
sweets, such as chips, crackers, and cookies, about 20
percent. Breakfast cereals and bars, including readyto-eat and cooked varieties, are the top contributor to
whole-grains intake during these life stages. Despite
the underconsumption of whole grains, intakes of

total grains trend toward overconsumption due to the
contribution of refined grains.
Total protein intake generally meets targets except for
adolescent females ages 14 through 18. Youth typically
meet or exceed recommendations for meats, poultry,
and eggs. Seafood, a protein subgroup that can support
intakes of beneficial fatty acids, is consumed at levels
far below the lower end of the recommended intakes
range. When seafood is consumed, it is typically
as part of a mixed dish rather than as an individual
food item.
Children and adolescents can improve intake patterns
by maintaining the components of a healthy diet that
are evident in early childhood, particularly total fruit
and dairy foods, while increasing consumption of food
groups that are underconsumed across all age groups,
specifically total vegetables and vegetable subgroups,
whole grains, and seafood. Reducing intakes of added
sugars, saturated fat, and sodium—components of
a dietary pattern that are often consumed above
recommended limits beginning at an early age—also
will support youth in achieving a healthy dietary pattern,
particularly when considering the very limited amount of
calories available outside of those needed for meeting
food group and nutrient goals.

c The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide joint advice regarding
seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for children.
Depending on body weight, some children should choose seafood

All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or
low-fat; and prepared with minimal added sugars, saturated fat,
refined starches, or sodium. If all food choices to meet food group
recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of
calories remain within the overall limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on
calories for other uses). The number of calories depends on the
total calorie level of the pattern and the amounts of food from each
food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the
specified limit can be used for added sugars and/or saturated
fat, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a
food group.
NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines
limits for added sugars and saturated fat; be within the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and
total fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded. See
Appendix 3 for all calorie levels of the pattern.

AGES 2-18

Special
Considerations
The nutrition considerations for the general U.S.
population described in Chapter 1 apply to children
and adolescents. For example, due to low intakes of
food groups as described above, the nutrients of public
health concern—calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and
dietary fiber—apply to these life stages as well. Although
the nutritional needs of youth are remarkably similar
to their parents, guardians, and caregivers, these age
groups do have some special nutrition considerations.
Specifically, increasing intakes of sugar-sweetened
beverages and decreasing intakes of dairy are dietary
components with notable and concerning shifts in
consumption throughout youth. Dietary intake patterns
for adolescents, particularly females, also are an area of
special consideration.
Accounting for the areas of dietary improvement that
are important for all children and adolescents, as well
as these special considerations, can improve diet quality
during a time when food preferences and intake patterns
are formed. When consistently followed, these healthy
dietary patterns can provide the foundation for healthy
dietary patterns in adulthood, promote health among
youth, and help prevent the onset of chronic disease
later in life.

Sugar-Sweetened Beverages

Sugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., soda, fruit drinks,
sports and energy drinks) are not necessary in the
child or adolescent diet nor are they a component of
the USDA Dietary Patterns. Intake of added sugars

increases throughout childhood and adolescence, and
sugar-sweetened beverages are a top contributor. As
a percent of total daily energy intake, average intake of
added sugars is 11 percent among young children and
peaks at 15 percent during adolescence. Coinciding with
this increase is the contribution of sugar-sweetened
beverages to total intake of added sugars. In childhood,
sugar-sweetened beverages make up about 15 to 25
percent of total added sugars intake. By adolescence,
their contribution is 32 percent and even higher when
considering coffee and tea beverages with added
sugars (an additional 7 percent). Most sugar-sweetened
beverages (e.g., soda, sports drinks) do not contribute
to meeting food group goals and often contain a high
number of calories.
Decreasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages
to reduce added sugars intake will help youth achieve
a healthy dietary pattern. Beverages that contain no
added sugars should be the primary choice for children
and adolescents. These include water and unsweetened
fat-free or low-fat milk—including low-lactose or lactosefree options or fortified soy beverage—and 100% juice
within recommended amounts. Consuming beverages
with no added sugars is particularly important for young
children ages 2 through 8, when only a small number of
calories remains for other uses after meeting food group
and nutrient needs with nutrient-dense choices (Table
3-1). The number of calories available for other uses
increases slightly as energy needs increase throughout
adolescence to support growth and development
(Tables 3-2 and 3-3). However, most adolescents do not
consume foods and beverages in their nutrient-dense
forms, meaning they have few or no calories remaining
for added sugars.

Page 87 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents

AG ES 2 -18

Juice

Many juice products, such as fruit drinks, contain minimal juice content and are considered
sugar-sweetened beverages because they are primarily composed of water with added sugars.
The percent of juice in a beverage may be found on the package label, such as “contains 25%
juice” or “100% fruit juice.” The Nutrition Facts label identifies the amount of sugars in juice
products that are not naturally occurring (i.e., added sugars). Although 100% fruit juice without added sugars can
be part of a healthy dietary pattern, it is lower in dietary fiber than whole fruit. Dietary fiber is a dietary component
of public health concern. With the recognition that fruit should mostly be consumed in whole forms, the amount
of fruit juice in the USDA Food Patterns ranges from 4 fluid ounces at the lower calorie levels and no more than 10
fluid ounces at the highest calorie levels.

Dairy and Fortified Soy Alternatives

Throughout childhood and adolescence, the types of dairy foods
consumed and their contribution to a healthy dietary pattern change. Milk
consumption, particularly milk as a beverage, is lower and cheese intake,
typically as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches, pizza, or pasta, is
higher among adolescents when compared to younger children. These
differences in consumption occur alongside the widening gap between
current and recommended intakes of dairy foods that occurs throughout
youth. Nutrient-dense options within the dairy group are unsweetened
fat-free and low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified soy beverages
and yogurt, and low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products. Dairy and
fortified soy alternatives provide protein and a variety of nutrients that are
underconsumed during these life stages. These include three nutrients
of public health concern discussed in Chapter 1: potassium, calcium,
and vitamin D. The nutrient composition of dairy foods highlights the
importance of adequate consumption. This is especially relevant for
calcium and vitamin D, given that adolescents have an increased need for
consumption to support the accrual of bone mass.

Adolescent Nutrition

The difference between recommended food group amounts and current
intakes is greater for adolescents ages 14 through 18 than for any other
age group across the lifespan. As a result, adolescents are at greater risk
of dietary inadequacy than are other age groups. For adolescent males
and females, low intakes of nutrient-dense foods and beverages within
the grains, dairy and alternatives, fruits, and vegetables food groups
lead to low intakes of phosphorus, magnesium, and choline. Adolescent
females also consume less meat, poultry, and eggs than do adolescent
males, and in combination with low consumption of seafood and other
protein subgroups, including beans, peas, and lentils, this results in the
underconsumption of total protein. In addition, adolescent females
have low dietary intakes of iron, folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. The
potential for nutrient deficiencies existing alongside underconsumption of
nutrients of public health concern for all Americans creates a concerning
constellation of nutritional risks at a time of rapid growth and development
along with the onset of puberty, menarche, and hormonal changes.

AGES 2-18

Supporting
Healthy Eating
The physical, mental, and emotional changes that occur
as children transition from pre-school to school-age
and into adolescence come with diverse and changing
opportunities to support a healthy dietary pattern.
Support and active engagement from the various
people and places involved in the lives of children and
adolescents is necessary to help establish and maintain
healthy dietary patterns that support healthy weight and
the prevention of chronic disease.
In early childhood, parents, guardians, and caregivers
have a primary role in supporting healthy eating because
they control the foods and beverages purchased,
prepared, and served. Exposing young children to a
variety of nutrient-dense foods within each food group
helps build a healthy dietary pattern at an age when
taste preferences are acquired. Introducing children to
a variety of nutrient-dense foods can be challenging.
As children grow, their search for a sense of autonomy
and desire for independence often manifest through
selective or “picky” eating, food neophobia, or food “jags”
(eating only one or a few foods for periods of time).
Offering the same type of food to children multiple
times, in a variety of forms, or prepared in different ways
can increase acceptance and intake of healthy foods
within food groups. For example, children may show a

dislike for vegetables in the cooked form but accept
the raw version. Or, children may only accept fruit when
it is cut into small, bite-sized pieces. Even with these
strategies, parents, guardians, and caregivers of young
children should know it may take up to 8 to 10 exposures
before a child will accept a new food.
Children’s dietary patterns often resemble those of
their household, highlighting the importance of their
environment in the establishment of a healthy dietary
pattern. Shared meals through shopping, cooking,
and consumption provides parents, guardians, and
caregivers with an opportunity to model healthy
eating behaviors and dietary practices. By making
nutrient-dense foods and beverages part of the normal
household routine, children can observe and learn
healthy behaviors that can extend throughout later
life stages.
Ideally, children continue to be exposed to a healthy
dietary pattern as they experience changes to their daily
routines, such as spending time in child care or school
settings. As at home, eating occasions in these settings
can be used as opportunities to support a healthy dietary
pattern. For example, snacks can be used as a way to
promote intake of nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables,
like carrot sticks and hummus or apple slices, instead
of foods like chips or cookies. Using snacks as an
opportunity to encourage nutrient-dense food group
choices is especially relevant during early childhood
when the total volume of food consumed at regular
meals is lower and snacking is common.
When exposed to nutrient-dense foods and beverages
at an early age and supported in making healthy choices
across environments, a healthy dietary pattern can
be established and maintained as children transition
to the adolescence life stage. With this transition
comes increasing autonomy, increased influence of
peers, and decreased influence of parents, guardians,
and caregivers on food choice. As a result, foods and
beverages are more commonly consumed outside of
the home, often with a preference for convenience foods
that often are not nutrient-dense. Parents, guardians,
and caregivers can continue to support healthy eating
during this life stage by providing convenient access to
nutrient-dense foods; involving children and adolescents
in meal decisions, shopping, and cooking; and guiding
adolescents’ selection of food purchased and consumed
outside the home. In schools and community settings,
healthy eating can be encouraged by creating an
environment that makes healthy choices the norm.

Page 89 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents

AG ES 2 -18

Accessing a Healthy Dietary Pattern

• Outside of the school year, the Summer Food
Service Program (SFSP) fills the gap by ensuring
that children continue to receive nutritious meals
when school is not in session. The SFSP operates
at sites in a community where children can
receive nutritious meals in a safe and
supervised environment.

• The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) provides temporary benefits to families with
qualifying incomes for the purchase of foods and
beverages. About one-half of all SNAP participants
are children.1

Professionals working with youth and their families
can use these, and additional Government and
non-Government resources that exist at the community,
to support healthy eating during these life stages and to
establish the foundation for a healthy dietary pattern that
will promote health and support disease prevention in
later years.

Many resources exist to support healthy growth and
development during childhood and adolescence. The
following Government programs play an essential role
in providing access to healthy meals and educational
resources to support healthy dietary patterns for all
children and adolescents.

• Households with young children may be eligible for
the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC can help
families with limited resources meet their child’s
nutritional needs by providing nutritious foods to
supplement diets. WIC serves children up to the age
of 5 years who are at nutritional risk.
• In childcare and afterschool settings, the Child
and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) can
support the development of healthy dietary
patterns. CACFP is a nutrition program that provides
reimbursements for meals and snacks that align
with the Dietary Guidelines to eligible children
enrolled at childcare centers, daycare homes,
and in afterschool programs.
• School-age children can benefit from the National
School Lunch Program and School Breakfast
Program. The school meal programs can provide
nearly two-thirds of daily calories, and therefore play
an influential role in the development of a healthy
dietary pattern.

Looking Toward
Chapter 4: Adults
This chapter focused on nutrition issues relevant to
children and adolescents. These issues are particularly
important because this life stage encompasses
significant transitions, from young children who are
still dependent on parents, guardians, and caregivers
for all their food choices, to adolescents who are
highly independent in their food choices. Diet quality
tends to decrease as children mature into adolescence,
with resulting concerns about underconsumption
of nutrients of public health concern. Establishing
and maintaining healthy food and beverages choices
now can set a firm foundation for healthy dietary
patterns that reduce the risk of diet-related chronic
disease, an issue of increasing relevance to adults,
who are considered in the next chapter.

Introduction

T

he adult life stage (ages 19 through
59) is characterized by independence,
opportunity, and increased responsibility—
from starting or completing education
and training, to managing work and/or
family, to planning for the transition to
older adulthood. Balancing work or school
responsibilities with personal, family,
or other commitments can create real
or perceived barriers to healthy eating.
Constraints on available time and financial
resources may make it challenging for
adults to adopt and maintain a healthy
dietary pattern. Support for healthy food
and beverage choices across the multiple
places where adults live, work, play,
and gather is needed to improve dietary
patterns among adults.

Page 93 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults

Many individuals enter the adult
life stage with an unhealthy dietary
pattern already established from
the childhood and adolescent years.
A concerted effort to change this
trajectory and support adults in
adopting a healthy dietary pattern
is needed for better health and to
promote the well-being of family and
friends across life stages. Learned
food and beverage preferences, and
norms and values placed on diet,
physical activity, and health, can
positively or negatively influence
health because they can determine
an individual’s willingness to change
and maintain behaviors. These norms
and values, including preferences
toward certain types of food, attitudes
about healthy eating, and beliefs
about the importance of physical
activity, can extend beyond the
individual to larger social networks,
influencing the behaviors of friends
and older or younger family members.
Among adults caring for children,
role modeling healthy dietary choices
is important because the food
components of public health concern
observed in earlier life stages are
similar for adults.
Following a healthy dietary pattern,
engaging in regular physical
activity, and managing body weight
are critical during this life stage.
More than one-half of adults are
living with one or more chronic
disease—diseases that are often
related to poor-quality diets and
physical inactivity. Improving dietary
patterns in adulthood can play a
beneficial role in promoting health
and preventing the onset or rate of
progression of chronic disease. For
adults with overweight or obesity,
making healthful changes to dietary
patterns and increasing physical
activity will improve health and
prevent additional weight gain and/
or promote weight loss (see “The
Importance of Physical Activity” and
“Overweight and Obesity”).

A D U LT S AG ES 19-59

The Importance of Physical Activity
Adults who are physically active are healthier, feel better, and are less
likely to develop many chronic diseases than are adults who are inactive.
For adults, regular physical activity can provide both immediate benefits
(e.g., boost mood, reduce stress, improve sleep) and long-term benefits
(e.g., improved bone health and reduced risk of many diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, dementia, and many
types of cancer).
Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical
activity is better than none. To attain the most health benefits from
physical activity, adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderateintensity aerobic activity, like brisk walking or fast dancing, each week.
Adults also need muscle-strengthening activity, like lifting weights or
doing push-ups, at least 2 days each week.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans and related Move Your Way® resources have
more information about the benefits of physical activity and tips on how
to get started. Available at health.gov/paguidelines.

Overweight and Obesity
In the United States, 74 percent of adults have overweight or obesity,
creating an increased risk for the development of other chronic health
conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain
types of cancer.
Losing weight and maintaining weight loss is not a simple task. It
requires adults to reduce the number of calories they get from foods
and beverages and increase the amount expended through physical
activity. Weight loss and maintenance are not likely achieved using
short-term solutions. They require a commitment to long-term lifestyle
change and often need support from healthcare providers, family
members, and social networks. Intensive behavioral interventions that
use one or more strategies—like group sessions and changes in both
diet and physical activity—can be effective for individuals trying to lose
a significant amount of weight. In addressing obesity, professionals
should be mindful of health problems stemming from obesity-related
stigma and discrimination.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website provides
resources to support preventing weight gain (cdc.gov/healthyweight/
prevention/index.html) and losing weight (cdc.gov/healthyweight/
losing_weight/index.html).

Healthy Dietary
Patterns
Adults are encouraged to follow the
recommendations on the types of foods and
beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern
described in Chapter 1. Nutrition and Health
Across the Lifespan: The Guidelines and Key
Recommendations. The USDA Dietary Patterns
provide a framework of nutrient-dense foods and
beverages that can be adapted to accommodate
budget, culture, and personal preferences to help
adults follow a healthy dietary pattern and meet
the Guidelines and their Key Recommendations.
Table 4-1 displays the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern at eight calorie levels that are appropriate
for most adults ages 19 through 59 years to
illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food
groups and other dietary components that make
up healthy dietary patterns. In general, calorie
needs are lower for females compared to males.
Calorie needs decline throughout adulthood due
to changes in metabolism that accompany aging.
Level of physical activity, body composition, and
the presence of chronic disease are additional
factors that affect calorie needs.
Females ages 19 through 30 require about
1,800 to 2,400 calories a day. Males in this age
group have higher calorie needs of about 2,400
to 3,000 a day. Calorie needs for adults ages 31
through 59 are generally lower; most females
require about 1,600 to 2,200 calories a day and
males require about 2,200 to 3,000 calories a
day. Additional information on these estimates is
provided in Table 4-1 (footnote a) and in Appendix
2. Estimated Calorie Needs. The USDA Dietary
Patterns are discussed in greater detail in Chapter
1 and Appendix 3. USDA Dietary Patterns.

Nutrient-Dense Foods and Beverages

Nutrient-dense foods and beverages provide vitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting
components and have little added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Vegetables, fruits,
whole grains, seafood, eggs, beans, peas, and lentils, unsalted nuts and seeds, fat-free and
low-fat dairy products, and lean meats and poultry—when prepared with no or little added
sugars, saturated fat, and sodium—are nutrient-dense foods.

c All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or low-fat; and prepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches, saturated fat, or
sodium. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within the overall
limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The number of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and the amounts
of food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, saturated fat, or
alcohol, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.

NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol; be within the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded. See Appendix 3 for
all calorie levels of the pattern.

Average intakes of fruits, vegetables, and dairy
fall below the range of recommended intakes for
all adults. Although average total grains intakes
meets recommendations, Figures 4-2 and 4-4
show that intake of whole grains is well below
recommendations, and intakes of refined grains
exceeds the upper end of the recommended
intake range for adults in both age groups. Intakes
of protein foods generally meets or exceeds
recommended intake levels. Current patterns
generally include meats, poultry, eggs, and nuts,
seeds, and soy, while average intake of seafood
falls well below recommendations. Beans, peas,
and lentils—a subgroup of both the vegetable and
protein foods groups—also are underconsumed by
most adults.
Figures 4-1 and 4-3 show that adults are exceeding
recommendations for added sugars, saturated
fat, and sodium. About 60 percent of men and
65 percent of women exceed the limit for intakes
of added sugars. This is an average daily intake
of about 330 calories from added sugars for
men and around 250 calories for women. More
than 70 percent of adults are exceeding the
recommendations for saturated fat. The average
daily intakes of saturated fat is about 290 calories
for men and 210 calories for women. The calorie
levels relevant to most adults (1,600-3,000 calories)
have about 100 to 400 calories remaining after food
group recommendations are met through nutrientdense choices. Combined, these average amounts
of calories from added sugars and saturated fat
exceed the amount most adults have available—
and do not account for calories from alcoholic
beverages. For sodium, nearly all men and about
80 percent of women consume too much on a given
day. Men generally consume more than 4,000 mg of
sodium per day and women more than 3,000 mg.

Special
Considerations
The dietary considerations for the general U.S.
population, including adults, are described in Chapter 1.
The following sections of this chapter focus on several
special considerations to support a healthy dietary
pattern for adults that reflect adults’ current intake
patterns and the prevalence of overweight and obesity
and diet-related chronic disease that become more
apparent in this life stage. These considerations include
a focus on dietary changes to increase intakes of dietary
fiber, calcium, and vitamin D and to decrease intakes
of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Special
considerations related to alcoholic beverages also
are discussed.

Dietary Fiber

Dietary patterns that do not meet recommended
intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
contribute to low intakes of dietary fiber. More than
90 percent of women and 97 percent of men do not
meet recommended intakes for dietary fiber. This
aligns with intake patterns where fruits, vegetables,
and whole grains are underconsumed by more than
85 percent of adults. Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for
Age-Sex Groups provides dietary fiber goals for men
and women based on the Dietary Reference Intakes.
These recommendations are based on levels observed
to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Increasing
intakes of fruits, vegetables, and replacing refined
grains with whole grains to improve dietary fiber intakes
is especially important during this life stage, as the
impact of poor diet quality becomes apparent with
the onset and/or progression of diet-related chronic
diseases. Chapter 1 provides strategies on how to
increase intakes of these important food groups. A list
of common food sources of dietary fiber is available at
DietaryGuidelines.gov.

Calcium and Vitamin D

Calcium and vitamin D are important at any age, and
most adults do not consume adequate amounts.
Close to 30 percent of men and 60 percent of women
older than age 19 years do not consume enough
calcium, and more than 90 percent do not consume
enough vitamin D. Dietary patterns that do not meet
recommended intake amounts for food groups and
subgroups, which include sources of calcium and
vitamin D—such as dairy foods and fortified soy
alternatives and seafood—contribute to low intake of

these nutrients. Particular attention should be given
to consuming adequate amounts of foods with these
nutrients during adult years to promote optimal bone
health and prevent the onset of osteoporosis. Adequate
intake of calcium and vitamin D is particularly
important for adults during the time period when peak
bone mass is still actively accruing (ages 19 through
about 30) and, for women, in the post-menopausal
period when rapid bone remodeling occurs.
A healthy dietary pattern with nutrient-dense,
calcium-rich foods, such as low-fat milk and yogurt
and fortified soy alternatives and canned sardines
and salmon, can help adults better meet intake
recommendations. Vitamin D aids in the absorption
of calcium. Consuming the recommended amount
of seafood and choosing foods that are fortified with
vitamin D, including milk, fortified soy beverages, and
fortified soy yogurt, and some whole-grain cereals,
can help adults meet their needs. In addition to dietary
sources, the body can make vitamin D from the

Page 101 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults

A D U LT S AG ES 19-59

About 70 to 75 percent of adults exceed the 10-percent
limit on saturated fat as a result of selecting foods and
beverages across food groups that are not in nutrientdense forms. The top sources of saturated fat for
adults are sandwiches (e.g., deli sandwiches, burgers,
tacos, burritos, grilled cheese, hot dogs) and other
grain-based mixed dishes (e.g. spaghetti and meatballs,
casseroles, quesadillas) that typically contain
ingredients from several food groups that are not in
nutrient-dense forms, including grains, protein foods,
and dairy. Making changes to the type of ingredients as
well as amount and/or frequency of their consumption
will help adults lower saturated fat intake without a
need to eliminate these foods from the household diet.
Strategies include using lean meats and low-fat cheese
to prepare these foods or substituting beans in place
of meats as the protein source. Saturated fat also can
be reduced by substituting certain ingredients with
sources of unsaturated fat (e.g., using avocado, nuts,
or seeds in a dish instead of cheese). Cooking with oils
higher in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat
(e.g., canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and
sunflower) instead of butter also can reduce intakes
of saturated fat.

Sodium

sun. However, some individuals may have difficulty
producing sufficient vitamin D from sunlight exposure
or consuming enough vitamin D from foods and
beverages, so a supplement may be recommended
by a health professional. Appendix 1 provides calcium
and vitamin D goals for men and women based on
the Dietary Reference Intakes. A list of common
food sources of calcium and vitamin D is available at
DietaryGuidelines.gov.

Saturated Fat

Chapter 1 explains the importance of limiting intakes
of saturated fat to support healthy dietary patterns.
Staying within saturated fat limits and replacing
saturated fat with unsaturated fat is of particular
importance during the adult life stage. The prevalence
of coronary heart disease increases with age, and high
LDL cholesterol peaks between the ages of 50 to
59 in men and 60 to 69 in women.

The number of adults exceeding the Chronic Disease
Risk Reduction level for sodium (see Chapter 1 or
Appendix 1) during this life stage is concerning given
that 45 percent of adults ages 18 and older are living
with hypertension. During adulthood, prevalence of
hypertension increases from about 22 percent of
adults ages 18 through 39 to about 55 percent of
adults ages 40 through 59.1 Changing this trend is
important because hypertension is a preventable risk
factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Unlike
other factors that cannot be changed, such as genetics
and family history, reduced dietary intake of sodium
is a modifiable risk factor that can help improve blood
pressure control and reduce risk of hypertension.
Overconsumption of sodium occurs for several
reasons, as discussed in Chapter 1. Because sodium is
found in foods and beverages across all food groups,
with most coming from foods that have salt added
during commercial processing rather than salt added
to foods during or after preparation, reducing sodium
consumption will require a joint effort by individuals,
the food and beverage industry, and food service and
retail establishments.

Added Sugars

Most adults exceed recommended limits for added
sugars as a result of eating foods and drinking
beverages higher in added sugars and selecting
foods and beverages across food groups that are
not in nutrient-dense forms. Added sugars are of
particular concern for adults because exceeding limits
contributes to excess calorie intake.
BEVERAGES AS A SOURCE OF ADDED SUGARS
Sugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., soda, sports drinks,
energy drinks, fruit drinks) and sweetened coffees
and teas (including ready-to-drink varieties) contribute
over 40 percent of daily intake of added sugars. More
than in earlier life stages, adults consume coffees and
teas with additions, such as sugar and flavored syrup.
Frequent consumption of these and other beverages
containing added sugars can contribute to excess
calorie intake. Some sugar-sweetened beverages, such
as coffee and tea with milk, contribute to food group
intake (e.g., dairy) and can be made without added
sugars. Others, such as fruit drinks, can be replaced
with nutrient-dense options such as 100% juice to help
meet fruit group recommendations.
Most adults’ diets include choices across multiple
food groups that are not in nutrient-dense forms and
therefore cannot accommodate excess calories from
2 Additional

sweetened beverages. Intake of sugar-sweetened
beverages should be limited to small amounts and
most often replaced with beverage options that contain
no added sugars, such as water.
OTHER SOURCES OF ADDED SUGARS
A variety of foods and beverages contribute to the
remaining added sugars consumed by adults. In
addition to the contribution of sugar-sweetened
beverages and sweetened coffees and teas, about
30 percent come from desserts and sweet snacks,
candies, and sweetened breakfast cereals. The
remaining 30 percent of added sugars is consumed in
relatively small amounts across many food categories,
as discussed in Chapter 1. Many of these food
categories have seen market expansion in recent years.
For example, over the past decade, beverages, snacks,
and bakery foods have continuously topped the list
for the most new product introductions.2 As these and
other food categories continue to change and expand,
it is vital for individuals to learn how to identify the
amount of added sugars in a beverage or food product
by reading the Nutrition Facts label (see Chapter 1).
Understanding which food choices contribute to intakes
of added sugars without contributing to nutrient needs
can help individuals remove or replace these foods
with better choices that meet food group and nutrient
recommendations within calorie needs.

Alcoholic Beverages

Alcoholic beverages are not a component of the USDA
Dietary Patterns and their calories are considered
discretionary. Regular consumption of alcoholic
beverages can make it challenging for adults to meet
food group and nutrient needs while not consuming
excess calories. The ingredients in certain mixed drinks,
including soda, mixers, and heavy cream, also can
contribute to intake of added sugars and saturated fat.
The majority of U.S. adults consume alcoholic
beverages. About 66 percent of adults ages 21 through
59 report alcoholic beverage consumption in the
past month, and of those, approximately half report
binge drinking, sometimes multiple times per month.
Among adults who choose to drink, average intakes
of calories from alcoholic beverages exceed the
remaining calorie limit that is available after food group
recommendations are met.
There are some adults who should not drink alcoholic
beverages at all, such as if they are pregnant or might
be pregnant; younger than age 21; or recovering from
an alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control
the amount they drink. For those who choose to drink,
intakes should be limited to 1 drink or less in a day
for women and 2 drinks or less in a day for men, on
days when alcohol is consumed. More information in
available in Chapter 1 under Alcoholic Beverages.

Supporting
Healthy Eating
Individuals need support in making healthy choices
at home, work, and in the community to build healthy
dietary patterns.
Food retail outlets (e.g., grocery stores, convenience
stores, restaurants) provide adults with the option to
purchase ingredients to prepare foods themselves or
to purchase foods prepared by others. National food
expenditures suggest the purchase of prepared foods
is a regular habit for most adults, with expenditures
outpacing those of foods purchased for household
meal preparation.3 Estimates also suggest that the
younger generation of American adults are spending
an even larger proportion of their total food dollars on
prepared foods than are older generations.4

When adults prepare meals themselves, they have more
control over the types of food ingredients selected and
can focus on choosing nutrient-dense options that
contribute to food group goals with little or no added
sugars and saturated fat and less sodium. The same
is not always true when purchasing prepared foods,
despite changes and innovation in the marketplace,
such as menu and product labeling or reformulation.
For some adults, preparing and consuming healthy
meals at home will mean adopting a new habit and/or
learning new skills, such as meal planning. For others, it
may entail small changes to current routines. Planning
meals and snacks in advance with food groups and
nutrient-dense foods and beverages in mind can
support healthy eating at home and improve dietary
patterns of individuals and families. Preparing meals
with family and friends also presents an opportunity
for greater connection and enjoyment around food.
For adults who are parents, guardians, or caregivers of
children or adolescents, preparing meals also provides
an opportunity to teach valuable cooking skills and
model behaviors that support the adoption of healthy
dietary patterns across younger life stages.

It is not realistic or desirable to avoid the purchase and
consumption of foods prepared by others. Limits on
available time and the desire for convenience make
restaurant and ready-to-eat meals a part of many
household routines. Many of these settings also
provide for social enjoyment of food with friends and
family. However, foods prepared outside of the home
can contribute to the overconsumption of calories
as a result of large portion sizes and methods of
preparation. Being mindful of the portion sizes and
ingredients of prepared foods can help adults achieve
a healthy dietary pattern while still enjoying foods
prepared by others. Health promotion activities that
center on increasing consumer knowledge and access
to healthy options in the places where Americans
purchase prepared foods are needed to provide
support for adults in these efforts.
Health professionals play an important role in
supporting adults’ healthy eating behaviors. Helping
adults become more aware of the foods and
beverages that make up their typical dietary patterns
and identifying areas for improvement can empower
individuals to make changes to the types of foods they
purchase or prepare. Teaching skills like cooking and
meal planning and helping adults understand how to
read labels or make healthy menu substitutions also
will support the adoption of a healthy dietary pattern
during this life stage.
In settings where adults spend their time, changing
organizational practices, approaches, and/or policies
to support improved dietary patterns also is needed.
Strategies include offering healthy meals and snacks
in workplace cafeterias and vending machines, or
implementing educational programs tailored to
working adults. Or, communities can support farmers
markets, community gardens, and related educational
programming efforts.

Accessing a Healthy Dietary Pattern

A healthy dietary pattern can only be achieved when
adequate resources and supports exist in the places
where adults live, work, and gather. Food access is
crucial for adults to achieve a healthy dietary pattern
and is influenced by diverse factors, as discussed
in Chapter 1. Food insecurity, which occurs when
access to nutritionally adequate and safe food is
limited or uncertain, is most prevalent in households
with children and in single-parent households. Income
is one of the primary characteristics associated with
food insecurity. Government programs, such as the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or
the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations
(FDPIR), serve as a resource for low-income adults
by supplementing food budgets to support healthy
lifestyles. Adults with children or those caring for older
family members also may benefit from resources
discussed in Chapters 2, 3, and 6.
Additional Government and non-Government
resources, such as food banks or community meal
sites and programming offered through SNAP
Education (SNAP-Ed) and the Expanded Food and
Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), play a role in
providing food and educational resources to support
adults in making healthy food choices within a limited
budget. Innovative approaches to support health, such
as incentive programs at farmers markets or healthy
corner-store initiatives, continue to expand. Continued
attention and creativity in approaches to expand
food access are needed to support a healthy dietary
pattern for adults and the larger social networks that
they influence.

Looking Toward Chapter 5:
Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating
and Chapter 6: Older Adults
This chapter has discussed the importance of
a healthy dietary pattern and related special
considerations during the adult life stage. The chapter
recognizes that dietary patterns are generally well
established by the time individuals reach adulthood
and encourages adults to take advantage of the many
opportunities available to make changes that support
a healthy dietary pattern. Making these changes
can have important benefits for achieving a healthy
weight status, reducing chronic disease risk, and

promoting overall health. These considerations are
especially important for the life stages discussed in
the next two chapters. Chapter 5 takes a closer look
at a special time in the life of many adults—pregnancy
and lactation. This chapter echoes the same guidance
for adults on following a healthy dietary pattern and
discusses several special considerations that arise
during this life stage. Chapter 6 then makes the
transition from the Adults chapter to a focused look at
healthy eating for older adults.

Introduction

P

regnancy and lactation are special stages
of life for women, and nutrition plays a
vital role before, during, and after these life
stages to support the health of the mother
and her child. Following a healthy dietary
pattern is especially important for those who
are pregnant or lactating for several reasons.
Increased calorie and nutrient intakes
are necessary to support the growth and
development of the baby and to maintain
the mother’s health. Consuming a healthy
dietary pattern before and during pregnancy
also may improve pregnancy outcomes. In
addition, following a healthy dietary pattern
before and during pregnancy and lactation
has the potential to affect health outcomes
for both the mother and child in subsequent
life stages.

This chapter addresses some
important nutritional considerations
for women before pregnancy and
contains nutrition guidance for
women during pregnancy and
lactation. A healthy dietary pattern,
along with changing calorie and
nutrient needs during pregnancy and
lactation, are described throughout
the chapter. Special consideration is
given to the importance of achieving
and maintaining a healthy weight
before pregnancy, gaining weight
within gestational weight gain
guidelines, and returning to a healthy
weight during the postpartum
period. A healthy weight status
during these life stages has shortand long-term health benefits for the
mother and her child. The chapter
also discusses other considerations
important to pregnancy and
lactation, including those related
to intake of seafood, alcohol, and
caffeinated beverages. Finally,
during pregnancy, nausea, vomiting,
food aversions, and food cravings
can make it difficult for some
women to achieve optimal dietary
intake. The chapter discusses how
these can be considered when
helping women who are pregnant
or lactating make healthy food and
beverage choices.

Healthy Dietary
Patterns
Women who are pregnant or lactating are encouraged
to follow the recommendations on the types of
foods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary
pattern described in Chapter 1. Nutrition and Health
Across the Lifespan: The Dietary Guidelines and Key
Recommendations. The core elements of a healthy diet
for women during these life stages are similar to the
recommendations for women who are not pregnant.
Table 5-1 shows the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern
to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food
groups and other dietary components that make up
healthy dietary patterns at the six calorie levels most
relevant to women who are pregnant or lactating.
Following a healthy dietary pattern during these life
stages can help women meet the Guidelines and its
Key Recommendations. The USDA Dietary Patterns are
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 1 and Appendix 3.
USDA Dietary Patterns.
Table 5-2 summarizes estimated daily calorie
needs during pregnancy and lactation compared
to prepregnancy needs for women with a healthy
prepregnancy weight. Additional information on
estimates of prepregnancy calorie needs is provided in
Table 5-1 (footnote a) and in Appendix 2. Estimated
Calorie Needs. As shown in Table 5-2, calorie needs
generally increase as pregnancy progresses and remain
elevated during lactation. However, it is important to
note that women with a prepregnancy weight that is
considered overweight or obese have lower weight
gain recommendations than do women with a healthy
prepregnancy weight (see “Weight Management”).
Women should follow their healthcare provider’s
guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during
pregnancy and lactation, as many factors, including
prepregnancy weight status, gestational weight gain,
and multiple pregnancies, may affect calorie needs.
In general, it is important for women who are pregnant
to be under the care of a healthcare provider who
can monitor their health status and the progress of
their pregnancy.

of pregnancy and throughout lactation. In short, women
should meet their increased calorie and nutrient needs
with nutrient-dense foods instead of with foods high in
added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
The customizable components of the USDA Dietary
Patterns provide flexibility that allows women—or
professionals adapting these patterns—to choose from a
variety of foods and beverages within each food group to
suit individual preference, lifestyle, traditions, culture, and
budget. This flexibility in being able to select among a
variety of nutrient-dense options is particularly important
for women who experience pregnancy-induced nausea,
vomiting, or food aversions.
When making food and beverage choices, women
should know that unless it’s medically indicated to
avoid for her own health, women do not need to restrict
their choices during pregnancy or lactation to prevent
food allergy from developing in their child. However,
women who are pregnant should pay attention to some
important food safety considerations (see “Food Safety
During Pregnancy”).

Nutrient-Dense Foods
and Beverages

Nutrient-dense foods and
beverages provide vitamins,
minerals, and other health-promoting
components and have little added sugars,
saturated fat, and sodium. Vegetables, fruits,
whole grains, seafood, eggs, beans, peas, and
lentils, unsalted nuts
and seeds, fat-free and
low-fat dairy products,
and lean meats and
poultry—when prepared
with no or little added
sugars, saturated
fat, and sodium—are
nutrient-dense foods.

The increased calorie and nutrient needs for these life
stages should be met by consuming nutrient-dense food
choices as part of a healthy dietary pattern. One way to
achieve this is to follow the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern throughout pregnancy and lactation, but adjust
intake of food groups to reflect higher calorie patterns
recommended during the second and third trimesters

level ranges: Prepregnancy energy levels are calculated
based on median height and body weight for healthy body mass
index (BMI) for a reference woman, who is 5 feet 4 inches tall and
weighs 126 pounds. The calorie levels shown in this table include
estimates for women during the first trimester of pregnancy, when
calorie needs generally do not increase compared to prepregnancy
needs, plus the additional calories needed for the later trimesters
of pregnancy and during lactation. Calorie needs vary based on
many factors. Women with overweight or obesity have lower
recommended gestational weight gain during pregnancy, which
may affect calorie needs. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare
Professionals, available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator, can be
used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, height, weight,
activity level, and pregnancy or lactation status.

Definitions for each food group and subgroup and quantity (i.e., cup
or ounce equivalents) are provided in Chapter 1 and are compiled in
Appendix 3.

c The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide joint advice regarding
seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for women
who might become or are pregnant or lactating. Depending on

body weight, some women should choose seafood lowest in
methylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts in the Healthy
U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern. More information is available on the FDA
and EPA websites at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.
d All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or
low-fat; and prepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches,
saturated fat, or sodium. If all food choices to meet food group
recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of
calories remain within the overall limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on
calories for other uses). The number of calories depends on the total
calorie level of the pattern and the amounts of food from each food
group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified
limit can be used for added sugars and/or saturated fat, or to eat
more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.

NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines
limits for added sugars and saturated fat; be within the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total
fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded. See Appendix
3 for all calorie levels of the pattern.

adding 500 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the
energy needed for milk production during this time period, then
subtracting 170 calories/day to account for weight loss in the first
6 months postpartum.

Weight Management

Weight management is complex, so women should
seek advice from a healthcare provider on the
best way to achieve their goals. Women should
be encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy
weight before becoming pregnant, as well as follow
the gestational weight gain guidelines developed by
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine during pregnancy. These guidelines
are outlined in Table 5-3 and serve as a tool to
help balance the benefits and risks associated with
pregnancy weight change.

c The EER for the second 6 months of lactation is calculated by
adding 400 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the
energy needed for milk production during this time period. Weight
stability is assumed after 6 months postpartum.

b Calculations assume a 1.1 to 4.4 lb weight gain in the first trimester.
Current estimates show that about half of women
of childbearing age have a weight classification of
overweight or obese. Women with overweight or obesity frequently exceed gestational weight gain recommendations
during pregnancy, which increases the likelihood of excess postpartum weight retention.
Weight gain is a natural part of pregnancy, which is why it is important to have a plan. Meeting weight management
goals may improve pregnancy outcomes, such as increasing the likelihood of delivering a healthy weight infant and
improving the long-term health of both mother and child. Women are encouraged to partner with their healthcare
provider and other medical professionals to achieve their goals and optimize health outcomes.

Special
Considerations
The nutrition considerations for the general U.S.
population described in Chapter 1 apply to women who
are pregnant or lactating. For example, the nutrients of
public health concern—calcium, vitamin D, potassium,
and dietary fiber—apply to these life stages as well.
In addition, iron is a nutrient of public health concern
for women who are pregnant. These life stages also
have some special nutrient and dietary considerations
regarding folate, iodine, choline, seafood, alcoholic
beverages, and caffeinated beverages that are discussed
in the following sections of this chapter.

Meeting Nutrient Needs

As discussed in Chapter 1, nutritional needs should be
met primarily through foods and beverages. However,
this may be difficult for some women, especially
those who are pregnant. Most healthcare providers
recommend women who are pregnant or planning to
become pregnant take a daily prenatal vitamin and
mineral supplement in addition to consuming a healthy
dietary pattern. This may be especially important to
meet folate/folic acid, iron, iodine, and vitamin D needs
during pregnancy (see Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for
Age-Sex Groups).
Nutrient needs for women who are lactating differ from
those who are pregnant. Continued use of prenatal
supplements by women who are lactating may exceed
their needs for folic acid and iron. Women who are
lactating should not exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake
Level (UL) of 1,000 micrograms of folic acid and 45
milligrams of iron. Women should seek guidance from
a healthcare provider on appropriate use of prenatal or
other dietary supplements during lactation.

Folate/Folic Acid

The RDA for folate is higher during pregnancy and
lactation than all other life stages (see Appendix 1).
Adequate folic acid intake is particularly important prior
to conception and during the first trimester to help
prevent neural tube defects.
The United States Preventative Services Task Force
(USPSTF) recommends that all women who are planning
or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement
containing 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid. The critical
period for supplementation starts at least 1 month
before conception and continues through the first 2 to 3

months of pregnancy. Dietary supplements may contain
either folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF),
but only folic acid has been shown to prevent neural tube
defects. Most prenatal supplements sold in the United
States contain folic acid.
The recommendation for folic acid supplementation is
in addition to the amounts of food folate contained in
a healthy eating pattern. Folate is found inherently in
dark-green vegetables and beans, peas, and lentils. All
enriched grains (i.e., bread, pasta, rice, and cereal) and
some corn masa flours are fortified with folic acid.

Iron

Iron needs increase during pregnancy compared to
prepregnancy. For women who are lactating, before
menstruation returns, iron needs fall and then return
to prepregnancy levels once menstruation resumes
(see Appendix 1).
Iron is a key nutrient during pregnancy that supports
fetal development. Iron deficiency affects about 1 in
10 women who are pregnant and 1 in 4 women during
their third trimester. Heme iron, which is found in animal
source foods (e.g., lean meats, poultry, and some
seafood) is more readily absorbed by the body than the
non-heme iron found in plant source foods (e.g., beans,
peas, lentils, and dark-green vegetables). Additional iron
sources include foods enriched or fortified with
iron, such as many whole-wheat breads and ready-to-eat

Page 115 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating

WO M E N W H O A R E P R EG N A N T O R LACTATING

More than half of women continue to use prenatal
supplements during lactation. Most prenatal
supplements are designed to meet the higher iron needs
of pregnancy. Depending on various factors—such as
when menstruation returns—prenatal supplements
may exceed the iron needs of women who are lactating.
Women should seek guidance from a healthcare
provider regarding the appropriate level of iron
supplementation during lactation based on their
unique needs.

Iodine

Iodine needs increase substantially during pregnancy and
lactation (see Appendix 1). Adequate iodine intake during
pregnancy is important for neurocognitive development
of the fetus. Although women of reproductive age
generally have adequate iodine intake, some women,
particularly those who do not regularly consume dairy
products, eggs, seafood, or use iodized table salt, may
not consume enough iodine to meet increased needs
during pregnancy and lactation.
cereals. Absorption of iron from non-heme sources is
enhanced by consuming them along with vitamin C-rich
foods. Food source lists for both heme and non-heme
iron are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Women
who are pregnant or who are planning to become
pregnant are advised to take a supplement containing
iron when recommended by an obstetrician or other
healthcare provider.

Women who are pregnant or lactating should not be
encouraged to start using table salt if they do not do so
already. However, they should ensure that any table salt
used in cooking or added to food at the table is iodized.
Additionally, women who are pregnant or lactating may
need a supplement containing iodine in order to achieve
adequate intake. Many prenatal supplements do not
contain iodine. Thus, it is important to read the label.

Vegetarian or Vegan Dietary Patterns
During Pregnancy and Lactation

Women following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern
during these life stages may need to take special care
to ensure nutrient adequacy. Iron may be of particular
concern because plant source foods only contain
non-heme iron, which is less bioavailable than heme
iron. Food source lists for both heme and non-heme
iron are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Vitamin
B12 also is of concern because it is present only in
animal source foods. Women following a vegetarian or
vegan dietary pattern should consult with a healthcare
provider to determine whether supplementation of iron,
vitamin B12, and/or other nutrients such as choline,
zinc, iodine , or EPA/DHA is necessary and if so, the
appropriate levels to meet their unique needs.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating | Page 116

WOME N W H O AR E PR EGNANT O R L ACTAT ING

Choline

Choline needs also increase during pregnancy and
lactation (see Appendix 1). Adequate intake of choline
during these life stages helps to both replenish maternal
stores and support the growth and development of the
child’s brain and spinal cord.
Most women do not meet recommended intakes of
choline during pregnancy and lactation. Women are
encouraged to consume a variety of choline-containing
foods during these life stages. Choline can be found
throughout many food groups and subgroups. Meeting
recommended intakes for the dairy and protein
food groups—with eggs, meats, and some seafood
being notable sources—as well as the beans, peas,
and lentils subgroup can help meet choline needs.
Meeting nutrient needs through foods and beverages
is preferred, but women who are concerned about
meeting recommendations should speak with their
healthcare provider to determine whether choline
supplementation is appropriate. Many prenatal
supplements do not contain choline or only contain
small amounts inadequate to meet recommendations.

Seafood

Seafood intake during pregnancy is recommended, as
it is associated with favorable measures of cognitive
development in young children. Women who are
pregnant or lactating should consume at least 8 and
up to 12 ounces of a variety of seafood per week, from
choices lower in methylmercury. The U.S. Food and

Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) provide joint advice regarding
seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure
for women who might become or who are pregnant
or lactating. Methylmercury can be harmful to the
brain and nervous system if a person is exposed to
too much of it over time; this is particularly important
during pregnancy because eating too much of it can
have negative effects on the developing fetus. Based
on FDA and EPA’s advice, depending on body weight,
some women should choose seafood lowest in
methylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts
in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern. Additionally,
certain species of seafood (e.g., shark, swordfish, king
mackerel) should be avoided during pregnancy. More
information is available on the FDA or EPA websites at
FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.

Alcoholic Beverages

Women who are or who may be pregnant should not
drink alcohol. However, consumption of alcohol during
pregnancy continues to be of concern in the United
States. Among women who are pregnant, about 1 in
10 reported consuming alcohol during the past month,
with an average intake of 2 or more drink equivalents on
days alcohol is consumed.
It is not safe for women to drink any type or amount of
alcohol during pregnancy. Women who drink alcohol
and become pregnant should stop drinking immediately
and women who are trying to become pregnant should

Food Safety During
Pregnancy

not drink at all. Alcohol can harm the baby at any time during pregnancy,
even during the first or second month when a woman may not know she
is pregnant.
Not drinking alcohol also is the safest option for women who are lactating.
Generally, moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages by a woman who
is lactating (up to 1 standard drink in a day) is not known to be harmful
to the infant, especially if the woman waits at least 2 hours after a single
drink before nursing or expressing breast milk. Additional information
on breastfeeding and alcohol can be found at: cdc.gov/breastfeeding/
breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/
alcohol.html. Women considering consuming alcohol during lactation
should talk to their healthcare provider.

Caffeine

Many women consume caffeine during pregnancy or lactation. As discussed
in Chapter 1, most intake of caffeine in the United States comes from coffee,
tea, and soda. Caffeinated beverages vary widely in their caffeine content.
Caffeine passes from the mother to infant in small amounts through breast
milk, but usually does not adversely affect the infant when the mother
consumes low to moderate amounts (about 300 milligrams or less per
day, which is about 2 to 3 cups of coffee). More information is available
at: cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/dietand-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html. Women who could be or who are
pregnant should consult their healthcare providers for advice concerning
caffeine consumption.

Women who are pregnant and
their unborn children are more
susceptible than are the general
population to the effects of
foodborne illnesses, such as
listeriosis. They need to take
special care to keep foods
safe and to not eat foods that
increase the risk of foodborne
illness. During pregnancy, women
should only eat foods containing
seafood, meats, poultry, or
eggs that have been cooked to
recommended safe minimum
internal temperatures. They also
should take special precautions
not to consume unpasteurized
(raw) juice or milk, raw sprouts,
or some soft cheeses made from
unpasteurized milk. Deli and
luncheon meats and hot dogs
should be reheated to steaming
hot or 165°F to kill Listeria, the
bacteria that causes listeriosis.

Physical Activity During Pregnancy and Postpartum
PREGNANCY
Physical activity during pregnancy can benefit both the mother and the baby. Physical activity increases or
maintains cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces the risk of excessive weight gain and gestational diabetes.
For many benefits, healthy women without contraindications should do a least 150 minutes of moderateintensity aerobic activity a week, as they are able. Women who habitually did vigorous-intensity activity or
a lot of aerobic or muscle-strengthening physical activity before pregnancy can continue to do so during
pregnancy. Women can consult their healthcare provider about whether or how to adjust their physical
activity during pregnancy.
POSTPARTUM
Physical activity following the birth of a child continues to benefit a woman’s overall health. Physical activity
during the postpartum period increases cardiorespiratory fitness, improves mood, and reduces the symptoms
of postpartum depression. Additionally, physical activity can help achieve and maintain a healthy weight and,
when combined with caloric restriction, helps promote weight loss.
Women should start slow and build back up to more activity over time. Women should aim for at least 150
minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the Move
Your Way® communications campaign have information about the benefits of physical activity and tips to get
started. Available at health.gov/paguidelines.

Supporting
Healthy Eating
Many women have increased interest in and motivation
to make healthy lifestyle changes during pregnancy
and lactation. Furthermore, the dietary choices made
during these life stages can affect women’s health
and the health of their children. Supporting women in
adopting healthy dietary patterns during this important
time of life and sustaining them thereafter also enables
them to serve as role models when their children begin
transitioning to complementary foods.
Women who are pregnant or lactating face many
real or perceived barriers when trying to meet the
recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines. Constraints
on time and financial resources, limited access to highquality childcare and family leave policies, as well as
inadequate breastfeeding support at home or at work
are barriers women may face. These barriers should
be considered by all those who support women in their
efforts to follow a healthy dietary pattern.
Ensuring women have access to healthy, safe food
is vital due to the critical role nutrition plays in health
promotion during these life stages. This is particularly
critical for families dealing with food insecurity, which
is most prevalent in households with children and
in single-parent households. Participation in Federal
programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition
Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC),
which serves low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and
non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and infants and
children up to age 5, can help alleviate these challenges
and improve dietary intake for many women and
children facing economic hardship. The Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Food
Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)

can also serve as resources for low-income women
and their families by both supplementing food budgets
to support health and by providing nutrition education
through the SNAP-Ed program. Additionally, USDA’s
Healthy Eating on A Budget1 can help women and
families plan and prepare healthy, inexpensive meals.
Other Government and non-Government resources,
such as food banks or community meal programs,
also provide food and educational resources that can
support women in making healthy food choices for
themselves and their families.
Support during lactation can help women meet
their breastfeeding goals, despite significant
demands on their time and energy during this life
stage. Worksite programs and policies that allow
women adequate time to pump breast milk when
away from their child, as well as access to good
quality childcare, can allow women who return to
work to achieve breastfeeding goals. Access to
breastfeeding peer counselors, such as those used
in WIC, or free breastfeeding support groups through
local hospitals also can support women during this
life stage. Additionally, health professionals can
promote the USDA’s WIC Breastfeeding Support2
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services Office of Women’s Health (OWH) Your Guide
to Breastfeeding3 and their National Breastfeeding
Helpline4 (800-994-9662), which are freely accessible
to all women.
Health professionals, policymakers, worksite
administrators, community leaders, families,
and friends should consider these barriers and
opportunities when seeking to support women and
families. Developing programs and resources that
reduce barriers and create opportunities can help
women meet their dietary needs and improve their
overall health and the health of their children.

Introduction

lder adults include individuals ages
60 and older—a life stage that
includes a broad range of ages and is
influenced by a number of health and
social changes that affect this population’s
nutritional status. Compared to younger
adults, older adults are at greater risk of
chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular
disease and cancer, as well as health
conditions related to changes in bone and
muscle mass, such as osteoporosis and
sarcopenia, respectively. An increasing
number of older adults start this life stage
with excess body weight. Preventing
additional weight gain and achieving a
healthy weight by following a healthy
dietary pattern and adopting an active
lifestyle can support healthy aging.

Selecting healthy food and beverage choices is important for people
throughout this life stage, regardless of their race or ethnicity or their
current health status. It is never too late to make improvements. Older
adults should follow a healthy dietary pattern because of the changing
dietary needs and the heightened risk of malnutrition that occurs with
age. Older adults generally have lower calorie needs but similar or even
increased nutrient needs compared to younger adults. The overall nutrient
density of dietary patterns is particularly important to this age group. Lower
calorie needs result from less physical activity, changes in metabolism,
and/or age-related loss in bone and muscle mass. Other factors may affect
nutrient needs and absorption of nutrients in older adults, including chronic
disease and conditions, use of multiple medications, and changes in body
composition. The healthy dietary patterns described below take the unique
needs of older adults into account and are further supported by special
considerations and strategies for professionals to support healthy aging.
Page 123 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 6: Older Adults

Nutrient-Dense Foods
and Beverages

Nutrient-dense foods and
beverages provide vitamins,
minerals, and other healthpromoting components and
have little added sugars,
saturated fat, and sodium.
Vegetables, fruits, whole
grains, seafood, eggs, beans,
peas, and lentils, unsalted nuts
and seeds, fat-free and low-fat
dairy products, and lean meats
and poultry—when prepared
with no or little added sugars,
saturated fat, and sodium—are
nutrient-dense foods.

A D U LT S AG ES 6 0 A ND OLD ER

Healthy Dietary
Patterns
Older adults are encouraged to follow the
recommendations on the types of foods and beverages
that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in
Chapter 1. Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan:
The Guidelines and Key Recommendations. Table
6-1 displays the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern to
illustrate the specific food group amounts and limits
for other dietary components that make up healthy
dietary patterns at the six calorie levels most relevant
to older adults.
Calorie needs are generally lower for females compared
to males, and for those who are older, smaller, and less

physically active. Females ages 60 and older require
about 1,600 to 2,200 calories per day and males ages 60
and older require about 2,000 to 2,600 calories per day.
Additional information on these estimates is provided
in Table 6-1 (footnote a) and in Appendix 1. Estimated
Calorie Needs.
The USDA Food Patterns are discussed in greater detail in
Chapter 1. Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan: The
Guidelines and Key Recommendations and Appendix
3. USDA Dietary Patterns. The USDA Dietary Patterns
provide a framework to help older adults follow a healthy
dietary pattern and meet the Guidelines and their Key
Recommendations. The Patterns provide a variety of food
and beverage choices that allow individuals to customize
their choices within each food group based on lifestyle,
traditions, culture, and/or other individual needs.

Diet quality is highest among older adults
compared to other ages. Consistent with the
general U.S. population, however, this age group is
not meeting the recommendations for food group
and nutrient intakes and has a Healthy Eating
Index score of 63 out of 100. Older adults can
improve dietary intake by increasing consumption
of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy, while
ensuring protein intake meets recommendations.
Reducing intakes of added sugars, saturated fat,
and sodium also will help older adults achieve
recommendations and manage and avoid chronic
conditions (Figure 6-1). Older adults should
choose nutrient-dense options within each food
group and consume appropriate portion sizes
because calorie needs decline with age.

Special
Considerations
The nutrition considerations for the general U.S.
population described in Chapter 1. apply to older
adults. For example, the nutrients of public concern—
calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and dietary fiber—apply
to this age group as well. However, this age group also
has some special nutrition considerations that are
discussed in the following sections of this chapter. For
example, several additional nutrients are more likely to
be underconsumed during this life stage. These include
dietary protein and vitamin B12. Beverage intake,
particularly as it relates to hydration status, also is an
area of special consideration.

Protein

Consuming enough protein is important to prevent the
loss of lean muscle mass that occurs naturally with
age. Monitoring protein intake is especially important
as older adults transition through this life stage. Intake
patterns show average intakes of protein foods is
lower for individuals ages 71 and older compared to
adults ages 60 through 70. About 50 percent of women
and 30 percent of men 71 and older fall short of protein
foods recommendations.
The majority of protein in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary
Pattern is accounted for in the protein foods subgroups:
seafood; meats, poultry and eggs; nuts, seeds, and
soy products; and the vegetable subgroup of beans,
peas, and lentils, which also is considered a protein
foods subgroup. The dairy and fortified soy alternatives
food group is another source of dietary protein.
Most older adults are meeting or exceeding weekly
recommendations for meats, poultry, and eggs, making

this subgroup a common source of protein foods for
older adults (Table 6-1). However, seafood, dairy and
fortified soy alternatives, and beans, peas, and lentils are
underconsumed, yet provide important nutrients that
support healthy dietary patterns. For example, the dairy
food group provides calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin
B12 and the beans, peas, and lentils subgroup provides
dietary fiber. Many choices within the seafood subgroup
also provide vitamins D and B12 and calcium (if eaten
with bones), and beneficial fatty acids. Food sources
of calcium, vitamin D, and dietary fiber are available at
DietaryGuidelines.gov.
Many older adults can improve their dietary pattern
and better meet nutrient needs by choosing from
a wider variety of protein sources. In some cases,
this may mean using seafood more often in place
of meats, poultry, or eggs or using beans, peas, and
lentils in mixed dishes, such as soups, rice, or pasta
dishes. For others, it may mean maintaining current
intakes of protein and finding enjoyable ways to add
protein foods from underconsumed food groups and
subgroups in order to ensure that overall protein needs
are met.

Vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 is of concern for some older adults because
the ability to absorb this nutrient can decrease with
age and use of certain medications can decrease
absorption. Older adults are encouraged to meet the
recommendations for protein foods, a common source
of vitamin B12, and include foods fortified with vitamin
B12, such as breakfast cereals. Some individuals
also may require vitamin B12 dietary supplements.
Individuals are encouraged to speak with their
healthcare provider to determine what, if any,
supplementation is appropriate.

Dietary Supplements

Many adults in the United States take one or more dietary supplements either as a pill
or drink. Popular supplements include some nutrients that are underconsumed among
older adults, including calcium and vitamins D and B12. All sources of a nutrient or food
component—whether from food or a dietary supplement—should be considered when
assessing an individual’s dietary pattern, including any added sugars that may come from
supplement drinks. Older adults should track and discuss all dietary supplement use with
their healthcare provider. Beverage supplements should not replace regular food intake
unless instructed by a health professional. The National Institutes of Health, Office of
Dietary Supplements provides the My Dietary Supplement and Medicine Record1, to help
individuals track supplement and medicine use.

Beverages

Many older adults do not drink enough fluids to stay
hydrated. One reason for this is that the sensation of
thirst tends to decline with age. Concerns about bladder
control or issues with mobility also may hinder intake of
fluids among older adults. Mean intakes of beverages
show adults ages 60 and older consume significantly
fewer fluid ounces across all beverage types compared
to adults ages 59 and under—about 2 fewer cups per
day, most of which is due to drinking less water.
It is important that older adults drink plenty of water
to prevent dehydration and aid in the digestion of
food and absorption of nutrients. In addition to water,
choosing unsweetened beverages such as 100%
fruit or vegetable juice and low-fat or fat-free milk
or fortified soy beverage can support fluid intake to
prevent dehydration while helping to achieve food group
recommendations. The water that is contained in foods,
such as fruits, vegetables, and soups, contributes to
hydration status and is a contributor to total fluid intake.
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
The Dietary Guidelines do not recommend initiating
alcohol consumption for any reason. To help older
adults move toward a healthy dietary pattern and
minimize risks associated with drinking, older adults
can choose not to drink or drink in moderation—limiting
intakes to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink
or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed.
Older adults who choose to drink may experience the
effects of alcohol more quickly than they did when they
were younger. This puts older adults at higher risk of
falls, car crashes, and other injuries that may result from
drinking. In addition, older adults tend to have a greater
number of comorbid health conditions than younger
adults, and alcohol use or misuse may adversely affect
the condition or interfere with management of the
disease. Certain older adults should avoid drinking
alcohol completely, including those who:
• Plan to drive or operate machinery, or participate in
activities that require skill, coordination, and alertness.
• Take certain over-the-counter or
prescription medications.
• Have certain medical conditions.
• Are recovering from alcohol use disorder or are
unable to control the amount they drink.
• More information on alcoholic beverages and their
relationship to health is provided in Chapter 1.

Supporting
Healthy Eating
Similar to other life stages, older adults can be
supported by professionals, family, and friends to
achieve a healthy dietary pattern that accounts for
factors such as cost, preferences, traditions, and
access. Additional factors to consider when supporting
healthy eating for older adults include:
• Enjoyment of food: Sharing meals with friends and
family can help increase food enjoyment and promote
adequacy of dietary intake for older adults.
• Ability to chew or swallow foods: Experimenting with
the preparation of foods from all food groups can
help identify textures that are acceptable, appealing,
and enjoyable for adults who have difficulties chewing
or swallowing. Good dental health is critical to overall
health, as well as the ability to chew foods properly.
• Food safety: Practicing safe food handling
procedures is of particular importance for older
adults due to a decline in immune system function
that accompanies age and that increases the risk of
foodborne illness. For more information: Foodsafety.
gov for older adults: foodsafety.gov/people-atrisk/older-adults or FDA: fda.gov/media/83744/
download.
Older adults have access to a variety of Government
resources to support a healthy dietary pattern as part
of overall healthy aging. Professionals working with
older Americans can use these resources to better
support access to healthy, safe, and affordable
food choices.
• Congregate Nutrition Services: The Older Americans
Act authorizes meals and related services in
congregate settings for any person age 60 and older
and their spouse of any age. Program sites offer
older individuals healthy meals and opportunities to
socialize. Congregate meals are typically provided
in senior centers, schools, churches, or other
community settings.
• Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP): Older adults with limited income may qualify
for SNAP, a Federal program that provides temporary
benefits to help individuals purchase foods and
beverages to support a healthy dietary pattern when
resources are constrained.

Physical Activity and Older Adults

The benefits of regular physical activity occur throughout life and are essential for healthy
aging. It is never too late to start being physically active. For older adults, regular physical
activity supports a number of additional health benefits including improved cognition,
balance, and bone strength. These benefits make it easier to perform activities of daily living,
preserves function and mobility, and lowers the risk of falls and injuries from falls.
Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical activity is better
than none. To attain the most health benefits from physical activity, older adults need at least
150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. The talk test is a good way
to assess moderate intensity for older adults. A person doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity can talk, but not
sing. Older adults also need muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days each week. Older adults should incorporate
multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the related
Move Your Way® resources have information about the benefits of physical activity and tips to get started. Available
at health.gov/paguidelines.

• Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP):
The CSFP supplements the diets of low-income older
adults by providing nutritious USDA packaged food
to support a healthy dietary pattern. The CSFP is
federally funded, and private and nonprofit institutions
facilitate the distribution of monthly CSFP packages
to eligible older adults.
• Home-Delivered Nutrition Services: The Older
Americans Act authorizes meals and related services
in a person’s home for individuals ages 60 and
older and their spouse of any age. Older adults who
experience difficulty leaving the home due to frailty,
health concerns, or certain medical conditions may
benefit from home-delivered meals offered under the
Older Americans Act.
• Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP):
The CACFP is a Federal program that provides
reimbursements for nutritious meals and snacks
to older adults enrolled in daycare facilities. Older
adults receiving care at nonresidential care centers
may receive meals and snacks that meet nutrition
standards of the CACFP.
Additional resources to support older adults exist at
the community level. For example, the Senior Farmers
Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP) provides many
low-income seniors with access to fruits and vegetables
grown in their local communities. SNAP Education
(SNAP-Ed) programming may also be offered and

teach older adults cooking and shopping skills.
Individuals working within these settings must ensure
the availability of nutrient-dense foods and assist older
adults in choosing a healthy dietary pattern that fits in
their cultural and food preferences.

Healthy Eating
Through the Lifespan
This chapter has focused on the unique nutritional
considerations of the older adult life stage. It also has
reinforced the idea that the core elements of a healthy
dietary pattern are remarkably consistent across the
lifespan and across health outcomes. More than that, a
healthy dietary pattern is flexible—people can customize
the Dietary Guidelines recommendations to suit their
personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budget
considerations.
Beginning at the earliest life stage—infancy and
toddlerhood—a healthy dietary pattern can help people
achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk
of chronic diseases. However, it is never too late to
make improvements. People at any stage of life can
benefit by changing to nutrient-dense forms of foods
and beverages across all food groups, in recommended
amounts, and within calorie limits. The bottom line:
For lifelong good health, make every bite count with
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans!

Appendix 2:
Estimated Calorie Needs
The total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on the person’s age, sex, height, weight,
and level of physical activity. In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight, and other factors affect how many
calories should be consumed. Estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain energy balance for various age
and sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in Table A2-1 for toddlers ages 12 through
23 months and Table A2-2 for ages 2 and older. These estimates are based on the Estimated Energy Requirements
(EER) equations, using reference heights (average) and reference weights (healthy) for each age-sex group. For
toddlers, children, and adolescents, reference height and weight vary by age. For adults, the reference man is 5 feet
10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds.
Estimates range from 700 to 1,000 calories for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months. Estimated needs for young
children ages 2 through 8 range from 1,000 to 2,000 calories. A wider range of 1,400 to 3,200 calories is estimated
for older children and adolescents, with males generally having higher calorie needs than females.
Adult estimated calorie needs range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for females and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per
day for males. As shown, males generally require more calories than females. Due to reductions in basal metabolic
rate that occur with aging, calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age.
Estimated calorie needs during the first trimester of pregnancy generally do not increase compared to prepregnancy
needs. Additional calories needed for the later trimesters of pregnancy and during lactation are outlined in Table
A2-3 and include approximately 300 to 400 additional calories. It is recommended that women follow their
healthcare provider’s guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy as many factors, including
prepregnancy weight status, gestational weight gain, and multiple pregnancies, may affect calorie needs. Women
with overweight or obesity have lower recommended gestational weight gain during pregnancy, which may affect
calorie needs.
These calorie needs are only estimates, and approximations of individual calorie needs can be determined
with online tools. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals, available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator, can
be used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, height, weight, activity level, and pregnancy or lactation status.

b The

EER for the first 6 months of lactation is calculated by adding 500 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the energy needed for
milk production during this time period, then subtracting 170 calories/day to account for weight loss in the first 6 months postpartum.

c The EER for the second 6 months of lactation is calculated by adding 400 calories/day to prepregnancy needs to account for the energy needed
for milk production during this time period. Weight stability is assumed after 6 months postpartum.

Appendix 3:
USDA Dietary Patterns
The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern (Tables A3-1 and A3-2) is based on the types and proportions of foods
Americans typically consume but in nutrient-dense forms and appropriate amounts. The Healthy Vegetarian Dietary
Pattern (Tables A3-3 and A3-4) and the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern (Table A3-5) are variations
that also exemplify a healthy dietary pattern. For the first time, the Healthy U.S.-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Dietary
Patterns are provided for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving human milk or infant
formula. These patterns are designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while
staying within limits for overconsumed dietary components, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
The methodology used to develop and update these Patterns builds on the rich history USDA has in developing food
guides. This methodology includes using current food consumption data to determine the mix and proportions of
foods to include in each group. Food composition data is used to select a nutrient-dense representative for each
food and calculate nutrient profiles for each food group. As would be expected, most foods in their nutrient-dense
forms do contain some sodium and saturated fat. In a few cases, such as in the case of whole-wheat bread, the
most appropriate representative in current Federal databases contains a small amount of added sugars. Detailed
information about the representative foods, nutrient profiles, and patterns is available in the online appendix of the
Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.1
Amounts of each food group and subgroup within the patterns are based on nutrient and Dietary Guidelines
standards (see Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups). Standards for nutrient adequacy aim to meet the
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), which are designed to cover the needs of 97 percent of the population,
and Adequate Intakes (AI), which are used when an average nutrient requirement cannot be determined. The
Patterns meet these standards for almost all nutrients. For a few nutrients (vitamin D and vitamin E for all ages, and
choline for ages 2 and older), amounts in the Patterns are marginal or below the RDA or AI standard for many or all
age/sex groups. In most cases, an intake of these nutrients below the RDA or AI is not considered to be of public
health concern. For more information on dietary components of public health concern, see Chapter 1.
The Patterns have 12 calorie levels to meet the needs of individuals across the lifespan ages 2 and older. For
toddlers ages 12 through 23 months, who are no longer receiving either human milk or infant formula, the Patterns
are provided at 4 calorie levels. Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe healthy dietary patterns and relevant calorie levels
for each life stage. To follow these Patterns, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each
group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so
that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.

a Calorie level ranges: Energy levels are calculated based on median

length and body weight reference individuals. Calorie needs vary based
on many factors. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals
available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/ can be used to estimate
calorie needs based on age, sex, and weight.

b Definitions for each food group and subgroup and quantity (i.e., cup or
ounce equivalents) are provided in Chapter 1 and are compiled in Table
A3-2 (footnote c).
c All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms and prepared with
minimal added sugars, refined starches (which are a source of calories
but few or no other nutrients), or sodium. Food are also lean or in low-fat
forms with the exception of dairy, which includes whole-fat fluid milk,
reduced-fat plain yogurts, and reduced-fat cheese. There are no calories

Page 143 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Appendix 3

available for additional added sugars, saturated fat, or to eat more than
the recommended amount of food in a food group.
d In some cases, food subgroup amounts are greatest at the lower
calorie levels to help achieve nutrient adequacy when relatively small
number of calories are required.
e If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should
only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list in the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) joint “Advice About Eating Fish,” available at FDA.gov/
fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice. If consuming up to 3 ounces of
seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the
“Best Choices” list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g.,
flounder), salmon, tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters,

Table A3-1 Footnotes (continued)
sardines, squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting, clams, shad, and Atlantic mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood
per week, many commonly consumed varieties of seafood should be avoided because they cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per week by children
without the potential of exceeding safe methylmercury limits; examples that should not be consumed include: canned light tuna or white (albacore)
tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. For a complete list please see: FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.

a Patterns

at 1,000, 1,200, and 1,400 kcal levels are designed to meet the nutritional needs of children ages 2 through 8 years. Patterns from 1,600
to 3,200 kcal are designed to meet the nutritional needs of children 9 years and older and adults. If a child 4 through 8 years of age needs more
energy and, therefore, is following a pattern at 1,600 calories or more, his/her recommended amount from the dairy group should be 2½ cup eq
per day. Amount of dairy for children ages 9 through 18 is 3 cup eq per day regardless of calorie level. The 1,000 and 1,200 kcal level patterns are
not intended for children 9 and older or adults. The 1,400 kcal level is not intended for children ages 10 and older or adults.

c Food group amounts shown in cup equivalents (cup eq) or ounce equivalents (ounce eq). Oils are shown in grams. Quantity equivalents for each
food group are:

Vegetables, Fruits (1 cup eq): 1 cup raw or cooked vegetable or fruit; 1 cup vegetable or fruit juice; 2 cups leafy salad greens; ½ cup dried fruit
or vegetable.
Grains (1 ounce eq): ½ cup cooked rice, pasta, or cereal; 1 ounce dry pasta or rice; 1 medium (1 ounce) slice bread, tortilla, or flatbread; 1 ounce of
ready-to-eat cereal (about 1 cup of flaked cereal).
Dairy (1 cup eq): 1 cup milk, yogurt, or fortified soymilk; 1½ ounces natural cheese such as cheddar cheese or 2 ounces of processed cheese.
Protein Foods (1 ounce eq): 1 ounce lean meats, poultry, or seafood; 1 egg; ¼ cup cooked beans or tofu; 1 tbsp nut or seed butter;
½ ounce nuts or seeds.
d

Amounts of whole grains in the Patterns for children are less than the minimum of 3 ounce-eq in all Patterns recommended for adults.

e The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide joint advice regarding seafood
consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for women who might become or are pregnant or breastfeeding, and children. Depending on body
weight, some women and many children should choose seafood lowest in methylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts in the Healthy
US-Style Eating Pattern. For more information, see the FDA and EPA websites FDA.gov/fishadvice; EPA.gov/fishadvice.
f If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list in the FDA/EPA joint
“Advice About Eating Fish,” available at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, children
should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g., flounder), salmon, tilapia,
shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters, sardines, squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting, clams, shad, and Atlantic
mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, many commonly consumed varieties of seafood should be avoided because they
cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per week by children without the potential of exceeding safe methylmercury limits; examples that should not be
consumed include: canned light tuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. For a complete list please see: FDA.gov/fishadvice and
EPA.gov/fishadvice.
g Foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms, lean or low-fat and prepared with minimal added saturated fat, added sugars, refined
starches, or salt. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within
the overall limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The amount of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and the
amounts of food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, added
refined starches, saturated fat, alcohol, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.

NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol; be within the Acceptable
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total fats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded.

GOOD NUTRITION
FOR BREASTFEEDING
The Women’s encourages mothers to breastfeed their babies. Breast milk is the perfect food for
your baby.

Why breastfeed

Vitamin D

Breast milk:

Vitamin D helps the body absorb and use calcium.
It is made in the skin by the action of sunlight.
Only a small amount comes from food (oily fish,
egg yolk, margarine). Deficiency is common, especially
in women who have darker skin, spend most of their
time indoors or cover most of their body in clothing.
Deficiency can cause bone weakness and muscle
pain in women and skeletal abnormalities in babies.
Women at risk should get their vitamin D level checked
and if low a supplement will be needed. Their breastfed
babies will also need a vitamin D supplement suitable for
infants and children.

»» contains all the nutrients and growth factors needed
for your baby’s growth and development for the first
few months of life
»» is specially adapted to your baby’s immature
digestive system
»» helps to protect your baby against infection, diarrhoea
and allergies
»» is economical and already at the right temperature.
Just as your baby’s nutrition is important, so is your own
diet. Eating well during breastfeeding will help you meet
your need for extra nutrients as well as cope with the
physical demands of caring for a new baby. Try to make
time in your busy schedule to eat regular, varied meals.
See the Healthy Foods Guide and Sample Meals Plans
at the end of this fact sheet for information on what foods
to include in your daily diet and how to incorporate the
recommended daily serves into your everyday meals.

Important nutrients during breastfeeding
Protein
Breast milk contains protein to meet your baby’s growth
needs. Good sources of protein for breastfeeding mothers
include meat, chicken, eggs, cheese, yoghurt and
vegetarian choices such as nuts, tofu and legumes (lentils,
baked beans, split peas, etc.).

Calcium
Calcium is needed to maintain bone strength. The best
sources of calcium are dairy foods. Fish with edible bones,
such as canned salmon and sardines, are also a good
source. There are small amounts of calcium in other foods,
but on average about three-quarters of our calcium comes
from dairy foods. If you drink soy or other milks such as
almond or rice milk, check the label and choose a brand
with the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk (at least
100mg per 100ml). Low fat dairy foods are not lower in
calcium than the full fat versions.

Iron
Pregnancy can use up your iron stores so it is important
to replenish these when breastfeeding. The richest
sources of iron are liver, meat, chicken and fish. Iron
is also present in legumes as well as whole grains,
breakfast cereals, green leafy vegetables and Milo
and Ovaltine.
Women who were diagnosed with iron deficiency
in pregnancy should consult their doctor about whether
to continue taking iron tablets after pregnancy to rebuild
their iron stores.

Iodine
Iodine is needed for the normal brain development
of the baby. It can be difficult to get enough iodine
from the Australian food supply. Seafood, dairy
foods and iodine added to bread flour help meet the
needs of most of the population but this may not be
enough for breastfeeding women. If you are
breastfeeding an extra 150 micrograms (mcg or µg)
a day is recommended. This level is present in most
breastfeeding multivitamins. If you regularly use salt
in cooking or at table, changing to iodised salt is another
way of increasing iodine intake.

Fluids

Regaining your shape

You will need plenty of fluids during breastfeeding to
replace the fluid used in breast milk. You may find you
are thirstier so just drink to satisfy your thirst, usually at
least eight cups per day. All fluids count but water is a
better choice than sugary drinks such as fruit juice, soft
drink or cordial which may reduce your appetite for more
nourishing foods and will not help if you are watching
your weight.

Breastfeeding is an energetic process! Most women
will need more kilojoules (calories) than they did
during pregnancy.

Vegetarian eating during breastfeeding
A vegetarian diet can meet nutritional needs when
breastfeeding if care is taken to include adequate
protein, iron, vitamin B12 and calcium-containing foods.
Nuts, seeds and legumes (dried beans and lentils)
and food derived from them, such as tofu and hummus,
are good sources of protein and iron (see the chart
for serve sizes). Iron is not as well absorbed from
these foods as it is from meat so vegetarians also need
to eat other iron-containing foods such as wholegrain
cereals, iron-enriched breakfast cereals, wholegrain
breads and green leafy vegetables. Milo and Ovaltine
are also sources of iron. Vitamin C, which is present in
many fruits and vegetables, helps absorption of iron
from these foods if eaten in the same meal or snack.
If you do not consume dairy foods you will need either
calcium-fortified soy or other milk or a calcium supplement.
Vegans and vegetarians who eat few dairy foods or eggs
are at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency as this vitamin is
naturally present only in foods of animal origin. It is added
to certain brands of soy milk and meat substitutes but the
amount in these foods may not be enough if few other
sources of B12 are eaten.
B12 is needed for blood cell, nerve and brain development
of the baby. Pregnancy and breastfeeding can rapidly
deplete body stores. Breastfed babies of vegan mothers
are particularly at risk of B12 deficiency. Women at risk
should have their level checked and may need to take a
supplement. If you are concerned please discuss this with
your dietitian or doctor.

Some of the extra energy can be provided by the fat
stores your body laid down during pregnancy. Use your
weight and appetite as a guide to your energy needs.
Some women find that they need to eat more to satisfy
an increase in their appetite or to prevent rapid weight loss.
If necessary include extra snacks such as sandwiches,
milk drinks, fruit, nuts, yoghurt, cereal and milk, cheese
and crackers.
Other women have more trouble getting back to their
pre-pregnant weight. If you have gained extra weight
during pregnancy, breastfeeding may help you to lose
some weight, but watching what you eat is also important.
Aim for a slow steady weight loss over several months.
Strict dieting or skipping meals is not recommended as
you will not be able to meet your nutrient needs. However,
try to keep the high fat, high sugar foods to a minimum and
include some regular exercise. Here are some suggestions
that may help.
»» Limit high fat foods such as greasy take-away, pastries,
battered or crumbed foods, chips, crisps, rich desserts,
chocolate, ice-cream and sweet biscuits.
»» Grilling, steaming, baking, poaching and casseroling are
good low fat ways of cooking lean meat, fish or chicken.
»» Use butter or margarine sparingly.
»» Use low fat dairy products such as low fat milk, low fat
yoghurt and reduced fat cheeses.
»» Although sugar has fewer kilojoules than fats, large
amounts add up. Sweet drinks such as soft drinks,
cordials and juices have between 4 to 14 teaspoons or
sugar per drink.
»» Plan and shop so that you have the ingredients for
healthy meals and snacks on hand.

Exercise
Regular exercise will help you regain your shape and
is also important for general wellbeing. Walking is a safe
‘fat burning’ activity and probably the most convenient
while your baby is still in a pram. Aim for a 30 minute walk
most days.

Frequently asked questions
Will certain foods cause allergy or colic?
Everything in moderation is a good rule. There is no
scientific basis to suggest that some foods cause gas,
wind or colic in babies. No specific food has been proven
to upset babies so mothers need not avoid foods unless
they continually cause problems, for example, rashes,
stomach discomfort or diarrhoea in your baby.
At present there is no evidence to suggest that avoiding
certain foods during breastfeeding will reduce the risk of
the child developing an allergy, even if there is a family
history of allergy. For more information on this speak to
your doctor, dietitian or maternal and child health nurse.
If you wish to avoid foods while breastfeeding for any
reason, you may need expert guidance to prevent
nutritional imbalances.

Can I drink coffee?
A small amount of caffeine from coffee, tea, cola and
energy drinks enters the breast milk. Most women
can drink moderate amounts of caffeinated drinks
without affecting the baby. However some babies,
especially newborns, are sensitive to even small
amounts of caffeine and it may contribute to irritability
or sleeplessness. Large amounts of caffeine may also
inhibit the milk let-down reflex.

Can I drink alcohol?
Alcohol passes into the breast milk. It reduces the
amount of breast milk the baby drinks, disrupts the
baby’s sleep pattern and may affect the baby’s
development. Not drinking is the safest choice.
If you choose to drink alcohol it is best avoided during
the first month while breastfeeding and sleep patterns
are being established. After that, (if you do drink),
limit to 1 to 2 standard drinks, but don’t drink every day
and don’t drink just before breastfeeding. Because
alcohol passes quickly into breast milk it is best to drink
just after breastfeeding then wait 2 to 3 hours for the level
to fall before feeding again.

Do I still need to avoid foods that may
contain listeria?
No, breastfeeding is not considered to be a high risk
for listeria infection so you can enjoy any favorite foods
you’ve been missing.

GOOD NUTRITION FOR BREASTFEEDING D14-158 - APRIL 2021

Are herbal and traditional medicines safe
to take while breastfeeding?
Some herbal preparations pass through the breast
milk to the baby and may be harmful. Check with
a health care professional before taking these
preparations. More information is available in our fact
sheet Herbal and traditional medicines in breastfeeding.

How long can I breastfeed my baby?
Breast milk alone provides all the nutrients needed for
growth and development of your baby for around the
first six months. After this gradually introduce solids until
your baby is eating a full balanced diet. Breast milk will
continue to be an important part of your baby’s diet for
at least the first year of life. You can continue to breastfeed,
to provide comfort, nutrition and protection, for as long as
you and your baby desire.

Importance of nutrition in lactating mothers in terms of both
the mother’s and the infant’s health
Mukadder Ayşe Selimoğlu
İnönü University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatrics, Malatya, Turkey

Summary
A balanced diet for lactating mothers is essential for providing physiological needs of the mother and for the health of the infant via ideal
breastmilk content. Nutrient profile of breastmilk is minimally affected by the mother’s diet by giving priority to protection of infant; protein,
fat, carbohydrates and folate are sufficient in breastmilk even if they lack in the mother’s diet. However, this may be harmful for mothers
because of consequent shortage of nutrient storages. On the other hand, some nutrients such as vitamin A, thiamin, and riboflavin are
dependent on the diet of the mother; if they are insufficient in the mother’s diet, so are they in breastmilk and in the infant. Micronutrient
insufficiency is an important health problem in Turkish mothers. In that context, the importance of a balanced diet in lactating mothers
for both their own healths and ideal breastmilk content should be emphasized. Making projects about this issue should be a priority for
countries where micronutrient insufficiency is frequent. (Turk Arch Ped 2013; 48: 183-187)
Key words: Breastmilk, infant, nursing mother, nutrition

Introduction
A balanced diet for lactating mothers is essential
for providing physiological needs of the mother and for
balancing the nutritional reserve and for healthy growth
and development of the infant via ideal breastmilk amount
and content. During this period when the highest nutritional
requirements are experienced, the organism of the mother
is equipped with accommodation mechanisms to protect
both her own health and the infant’s health. Due to these
accommodations the deficiency in the mother’s diet is
reflected at the lowest level in the infant. It is sure that
each accommodation has its limits and therefore nutritional
deficiencies may lead to problems in the infant in the shortterm or long-term. In this balance, the loser is primarily the
mother. Only if the mother has malnutrition or if there is an
adolescent pregnancy which has a nonignorable frequency
(5,9%) in our country, the nutrients are used in the mother
and the infant may be harmed (1,2,3).

The favorable effects of breastmilk on the health of
infants and adults is being understood better every passing
day. Therefore, community-scale efforts should be made
for a more successful breastfeeding period. The health of
the infant achieved by increasing the amount of breastmilk
and a more ideal breastmilk content are emphasized, but
the health of the mother is ignored.
The effect of the mother’s diet on the amount of
breastmilk
It is known that nutrition of the mother with a non-ideal
and even a poor diet does not interfere with breastfeeding
(4). If the mother does not have a severe malnutrition, the
effect of the nutritional status on the amount of breastmilk
is negligible (2). Excessive energy is needed for the nursing
mother to produce milk. To provide this excessive energy,
generally the amount of eating of the mother is increased,
but even if it is not increased, suıfficient milk can be
produced (5). In this case, the fat stores of the mother are
used as energy source and the mother loses weight. In

Mukadder Ayşe Selimoğlu
Nutrition in lactating mothers

healthy mothers, 800 g/month weight loss is observed in
the first 6 months after delivery. In mothers with malnutrition,
100 g/month weight loss is observed (6). It is not healthy to
lose more than 2 kg/month during the lactation period (2).
The amount of energy taken and the amount of milk
produced are not directly related. The amount of breastmilk
shows sufficient sucking of the infant rather than the milk
production capacity of the mother. Thus, if the nursing
technique is accurate and the infant is sucking in a healthy
and willing way, the milk production is sufficient (7,8).
Except for excessive limitation of energy, the energy
amount of the diet does not affect the amount of breastmilk
(4). The amount of breastmilk in mothers with malnutrition
may be lower. This may be related with the amount of
energy taken or insufficient sucking of the low birth weight
infant (4). Studies show that the amount of milk decreases,
if the daily energy intake of the mother is lower than 1800
kcal (9).
It was shown that energy support did not increase the
amount of breastmilk, but mothers with malnutrition could
maintain their stores and nurse longer when supplements
were given (2,10,11).

The effects of the mother’s diet on the content
of breastmilk and on the mother
Energy:
There are studies which have shown that the content
of breastmilk (density) is related with the body structure
of the mother or weigth gain during pregnancy (12,13,14).
Restrictive diets lead to a decrease in the energy intensity
in breastmilk especially in mothers with malnutrition, but
changing the amount of energy in the diet does not lead
to a change in the content of breastmilk in mothers with a
normal body weight (2).
The amount of excess energy required by a nursing
mother is approximately 750 kcal/day. The mother meets
500 calories of this from her diet and the remaining
250 calories are met from the fat stores gained during
pregnancy. Thus, the mother can lose 5 kg in 6 months
after delivery. However, it is not recommended that nursing
mothers lose weight in a short time (>0.5 kg/week) (2).
Protein:
The effect of low-protein diet on breastmilk in nursing
mothers is not clear. There are publications reporting that
the protein content of breastmilk in mothers with malnutrition
is not low or not different from normal (2,4). There are also
publications indicating that protein support leads to a small
increase in the protein amount of breastmilk, does not lead
to any change or increases the amount of breastmilk without
affecting the content (2,4,15,16). Protein requirement is
high in nursing mothers. One should be more careful in
vegetarian mothers.

Turk Arch Ped 2013; 183-187

Fat:
Long chain fatty acids (LCPUFA) are essential nutrients
for development of the normal brain development in
infants. The factors which affect LCPUFA synthesis in the
mother include intake of trans fatty acids, deficiency of
iron, magnesium, zinc, calcium, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and
B12 and protein-poor and sucrose-rich diets (2). Thus, the
mother should eat healthyly and deficiencies of vitamins
and minerals should be absent for an ideal LCPUFA status.
It is known that fat intake in nursing mothers may
change the content of breastmilk (2,4). The proportion of
fat in breastmilk is related with the body structure of the
mother and weight gain and diet intake during pregnancy.
With very-low-fat diets the proportion of fat in breastmilk
decreases, but the infant can take sufficient energy from
breastmilk, if he/she sucks adequately (2). In addition, the
deficit can be closed by synthesis of medium-chain-fatty
acids in the breast, if the mother has adequate energy
intake despite low-fat diet. If both energy and fat intake is
low, the composition of fatty acids in breastmilk reflects the
fat stores of the mother (17).
In the breastmilk of vegetarian mothers, the level of
lineloic acid is higher and the level of docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) is lower. The level of DHA is higher in the breastmilk
of mothers who consume fish (18). Sine a significant
amount of LCPUFA is transferred to the breastmilk, nursing
mothers’ requirement is high (2).
Minerals and vitamins:
In a nursing mother with iron deficiency, the risk for
disease is increased and the success of nursing may be
decreased because of reasons including weakness and
fatigue. Iron requirement which is increased during lactation
in healthy mothers is compensated by lack of mensturation
and increased absorption during lactation. The factors
which lead to development of iron deficiency during
lactation include iron status before pregnancy, hemorrhage
after delivery, vegetarianism, low-vitamin C diet, excessive
tea consumption, frequent pregnancies, early pregnancy
and low socioeconomical status (2,4).
The amount of calcium in breastmilk is determined
by increased bone absorption and not by the amount in
the mother’s diet (19). It was shown that the content of
breastmilk and bone mineralization of the infant did not
change in mothers who were given calcium supplements
(19). Thus, the amount of calcium in breastmilk is
independent of the diet. Estrogen which decreases during
lactation provides sufficient calcium by increasing bone
absorption. Since the highest bone mass is achieved at the
age of 18-20 years, the requirement in adolescent mothers
is higher (2).
The requirement of zinc is increased during lactation.
Zinc which is released because of reduced uterus and
reduced blood supply supports the stores in the mother

Turk Arch Ped 2013; 183-187

in the first month of lactation (20). It has been reported
that external zinc supplements do not change the amount
in breastmilk and the amount of zinc in breastmilk is not
affected by low intake (21).
Magnesium is an essential mineral for energy production
and bone tissue. The amount in breastmilk is not affected
by the diet and there is no evidence that the requirement is
increased during lactation (2).
Iodine is essential for thyroid metabolism. The amount
in earth and soil affects the amount in the diet. The
requirement increases during lactation and the amount in
breastmilk is directly related with the intake of the mother.
The amount in breastmilk is decreased in areas of iodine
deficiency (2,4).
The requirement for vitamin A in nursing mothers is
increased and the amount in breastmilk is affected by
the diet. When there is deficiecy in the mother, the infant
is affected directly (2). The level of vitamin A is lower in
low-income families in developing countries compared to
families in developed countries. Vitamin A supplements in
these mothers increase the level in breastmilk (22).
The group of mothers and thus infants carrying a risk in
terms of vitamin D deficiency is constituted of mothers who are
dependent to home, dark-skinned and veiled and their infants
and the uneducated group with a lower socioeconomical
status. Normally, the requirement in pregnancy and lactation
is not different from other periods (2).
During lactation, 4 mg vitamin E is trasferred to
breastmilk daily; this is the increase in the requirement (2).
Increasing vitamin K in the mother’s diet does not
protect the infant from hemorrhagic disease (2).
The requirement of folic acid is increased during
lactation. When there is deficiency of folic acid, the amount
in breastmilk is maintained, but the mother is harmed (2).
During lactation, the requirement of thiamin is increased.
The amount in breastmilk reflects the intake in the diet.
Similarly, the amounts of riboflavin, niacin and vitamin
B6 reflect intake. Riboflavin deficiency may be observed
especially in individuals who do not consume milk. Infants
are dependent on the diet of the mother in terms of vitamin
B12 and one should pay special attention to vegetarian
mothers (2).
Vitamin C in breastmilk is also affected by the diet of
the mother (2).
The nutritional status of mothers in Turkey
According to the Turkey Demographic and Health
surveys (2008) 1.8 % of our women were found to
have malnutrition (BMI<18.5), 34.3% were found to be
overweight (BMI = 25-30) and 22.7% were found to be
obese (BMI>30) when evaluated in terms of body mass
index (BMI) (3). Thus, energy deficiency is not a significant
problem in Turkish women.

Although protein consumption per capita seems to be
adequate in our country, it is observed that its distribution is
problematic (rural and urban) and intake of animal protein
is low (23). Similarly, intake of calcium, vitamin A and
riboflavin is lower than the recommended levels (23).
In studies conducted with adolescents, deficiency
was considered as a level lower than 67% of the daily
recommended amount and it was shown that energy
was consumed lower by 20-43%, protein was consumed
lower by 8-24%, vitamin A was consumed lower by 3259%, riboflavin was consumed lower by 30-70%, iron was
consumed lower by 28-70% and calcium was consumed
lower by 16-39% (23). According to population cencus
statistics 5.9% of the deliveries in 2001 were constituted of
adolescent pregnancies (15-19 years) (3). This creates the
concern that micronutrient deficiencies during this period
would be more exaggerated in terms of both the infant and
the mother.
In studies conducted with pregnant women, it was shown
that intake of energy, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A, tiamin
and riboflavin was lower than 67% of the recommended daily
intake (23). When the prenatal and postnatal periods were
evaluated, it was reported that nutrients were taken deficiently
except for energy, protein and vitamin E and C (23).
In a study conducted with nursing mothers, it was shown
that mothers were at risk of iron deficiency (39%), riboflavin
deficiency (43%), vitamin B6 deficiency (36%), vitamin B12
(60%) and folic acid deficiency (73%) (23).
It is known that 50% of pregnant and nursing mothers
in Turkey have iron deficiency (23,24,25). In a study
performed in 823 pregnant women in the province of
Malatya in 2010, the frequency of anemia was found to be
27%. Iron deficiency was found in 50% of these, vitamin
B12 deficiency was found in 35% and folate deficiency was
found in 72% (26).
In a study performed in Manisa and İzmir in 2008 (27),
vitamin A and E deficiencies were not found in mothers
living in these provinces, but plasma vitamin A level
was found to be low in 46% of pregnant women living in
Gaziantep and vitamin A deficiency was found in 17% of
the subjects(28). Especially, emphasizing the decrease in
vitamin A in the last three months suggests that the risk of
vitamin A deficiency will increase during lactation.
In different studies, severe vitamin D deficiency was
found with a rate of 10-27%, moderate vitamin D deficiency
was found with a rate of 40-54% and mild vitamin D
deficiency was found with a rate of 40% in pregnancy
(29,30). The more unpleasant finding was that the rate of
deficiency in the control group who were not pregnant was
also high (severe deficiency 27%, moderate deficiency
45%) (29). In another study, severe vitamin D deficiency
was found in the last three months of pregnancy in 46% of
pregnant Turkish women (31).

Nutrition in lactating mothers

In a study, vitamin D deficiency was found with
rates of 40%, 60% and 100% in our women who were
open, moderately veiled and completely veiled women,
respectively (32). In a study conducted with adolescents,
vitamin D inadequacy was found with a rate of 44% and
vitamin D deficiency was found with a rate of 21% (33).
Vitamin D deficiency was found in half of adolescent girls
who were veiled and living in a city (33).

Conclusions
Nutrition of nursing mothers is special. It is very
significant in terms of both the mother’s own health and
the infant’s health. The nutritional content of the mother is
affected by diet with a low rate bringing protection of the
infant to forefront. Even if the diet of the mother is poor
in terms of protein, fat, carbonhydrate and folate, the
amounts in breastmilk stay adequate (34). However, this
state which does not affect the infant leads to deficiency in
the mother’s stores and consequently harms the mother.
The levels of vitamin A and B in breastmilk are dependent
to the mother’s diet. If they are deficient in the mother,
deficiency also develops in the infant. Studies performed
in Turkey show that micronutrient deficiency in mothers in
Turkey is a significant problem and micronutrient deficit is
present with a high frequency in mothers. Considering that
approximately 6% of our mothers are in the adolescence
during which growth and development is not completed yet,
it is clear that nutritional supplements in mothers will be
beneficial in terms of public health. In this context, it is a
significant priority that nutrition in mothers is emphasized
and plans are produced in terms of both the mother’s
health and ideal breastmilk content.

Introduction
Perhaps you just learned that you are pregnant? Your baby may not
even seem real yet. However the choices you make and what you eat
now and every day you are pregnant or breastfeeding can affect your
health and the health of your baby.
It is your choice:
•
•
•
•

what you eat
whether you drink alcohol and/or smoke
how much your weight may change
how often you see your doctor

Pregnancy is a very important period. It is a time to think about your
lifestyle, habits and diet and how they affect you and your future child.
It is a time to consider if you wish to adopt healthy habits that will be
beneficial to you and your baby both now and in the future.
It is never too late to make the right choices.
When you are expecting a baby or breastfeeding a baby, nutritious
food is very important for both of you:
For You: pregnancy and lactation place extra demands on your body.
To meet these demands you need to think about what is best to eat and
drink. Good nutrition in pregnancy helps you to stay healthy and
energetic and to prepare yourself for taking care of you, your new
baby and the rest of the family.
For Your Baby: through your milk your baby eats everything you eat.
Thus, the best way of giving your baby a healthy diet is for you to eat a
healthy diet.

The Placenta - carries life to your baby:
The placenta brings important things, such as oxygen and nutrients, to
your baby and it removes the waste products that your baby produces
while in your womb.
However the placenta cannot stop harmful substances such as alcohol
and nicotine, from smoking, crossing from you to your baby

Healthy diet - what does it mean?
Contrary to a sometimes often quoted saying, you do not have to “eat
for two” - or double the amount of food you normally eat.
From about the 3rd month of pregnancy you need ONLY an extra 200300 kcal per day in addition to the diet you ate before you became
pregnant. This small extra amount can be achieved, by eating for
example 2-3 slices of bread extra (or 1 glass of milk and 1-2 slices of
bread extra) per day.
A healthy diet is one that is based mainly on plant foods. Therefore it is
important to eat lots of vegetables, fruits, bread, potatoes, pasta,
cereals, beans and lentils accompanied by only relatively small amounts
of: low fat milk, cheeses, kefir and yogurts; fish, lean red meats, and
poultry. Whenever possible try to get locally grown vegetables and
fruits, especially when they are in season. These can be less
expensive, more nutrient dense, fresh and safe from contamination.
The following explanation highlights the relative importance of different
foods by placing them into 5 food groups.

6

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

Food Groups
1. Bread, cereals, pasta, rice and potato group - aim to eat 6-11
portions per day

What counts as one portion?
1 large slice of bread (about 30-40 g)
3 small crackers or sooshka
1/2 cup cooked pasta (macaroni, spaghetti etc.)
1/2 cup cooked cereal (rice, buckwheat or oatmeal)
3/4 cup (about 30g) ready-to eat dry cereal
1 medium potato (100g)
Foods from this group provide you with your main source of energy. They
also contain many other important nutrients, such as calcium, iron, zinc and
B vitamins. Potatoes are also a good source of vitamin C.
Unrefined cereals and wholemeal bread are good sources of fiber
which prevents constipation which you may experience more of
during pregnancy.
Some breakfast cereals may be fortified with vitamins such as folic
acid - check the label.
Try to eat a variety of foods from this group, including wholemeal and
rye breads, macaroni, spaghetti, rice, buckwheat, oatmeal or your
traditional cereal and potatoes.

7

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

2. Vegetables and fruits group - aim to eat at least 5 portions per
day (more than 400g)

What counts as one portion?
1/2 cup (about 100 g) of vegetables (for example:
carrots, onions, beets, leeks, turnip etc. – including
that eaten in soups and stews)
1 cup of green leafy vegetables (cabbage, lettuce,
spinach, broccoli, etc.)
1 medium tomato
1/2 cup of sprouted beans
1 medium piece of fruit (1 apple or 1 pear or 2 small
plums)
1/2 cup (about 100 g) of fresh, preserved, or cooked
berries
160 ml fruit or vegetable juice (pure 100% juice - try
fresh carrot and orange squeezed and mixed)
Vegetables and fruits provide the best source of many vitamins and
minerals, including folate and iron, which are important to prevent you
becoming anaemic during pregnancy. Remember, vitamins such as
vitamin C are needed both by you and your baby and cannot be stored
in your body. Thus, it is important to eat plenty of vegetables and fruits
every day, especially those that are locally grown.
Each of the following will give you enough vitamin C every day:
1 large pepper or 3 medium potatoes or 160 g of cabbage.
In addition vegetables contain many protective components which help
keep us healthy: fibre, flavonoids and many more substances which we
have not even discovered yet! This is one reason why vitamin and
8

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

mineral tablets cannot replace the vegetables we eat.
Fresh vegetables and fruits may sometimes be difficult to find. Out of
season, when fresh produce may not be available, don’t forget about
frozen, home-preserved, tinned, pic kled and dried varieties - they also
contain essential nutrients. You might like to try “sprouting” beans
when no other sources of vitamin C are available.
The following fresh weight of sprouted beans will provide 10 mg
vitamin C:
Black-eyed beans
Fenugreek, Mung beans, green lentils
Haricot, Alfalfa

50 g
70 g
90 g

Remember, that vitamin C is lost during storage and preparation.
Therefore it is important to cook vegetables in a minimum amount of
boiling water for only 5 to 10 minutes. Try steaming, baking or
microwaving instead of boiling. Try to eat raw fresh or lightly cooked
vegetables every day and try not to add excess fats, oils and salt.
3. Milk and dairy products group - aim to eat 3 portions a day

What counts as one portion?
1 cup (about 200 ml) of yogurt/kefir
45 g of hard cheese (the size of matchbox)
1,5 cup (about 250 g) of cottage cheese
1 glass (300 ml) of milk
Dairy products are one of the richest sources of calcium in your diet.
Calcium is essential for the development of healthy bones and teeth of
your baby; in lactation it is important for the formation of your own
breast milk. However if you do not eat calcium containing foods your
9

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

baby will not suffer since calcium will be taken from your body stores.
But for your own health it is important that you replace your stores of
calcium.

10

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

Dairy products are also a good source of protein and other minerals
and vitamins, such as some B vitamins, vitamin A and sometimes
iodine depending on whether or not the cows are fed iodine fortified
fodder.
Contrary to the beliefs of some people, creamy, high-fat milk and dairy
products are not healthier than low-fat alternatives. Where possible
choose low-fat milk, kefir and low-fat milk products - they contain
more calcium and protein and have a lower fat content, so are good for
all of the family.
Remember, that neither butter (made from the cream of milk) nor
cream contribute calcium or protein to your diet, only fat.
4. Fish, poultry, meat and bean group - aim to eat 2 portions a
day

What counts as one portion?
1 cup (about 150-200 g) of cooked beans
2 eggs
70-80 g of cooked lean fish, poultry or meat
This group includes beans and lentils, fish, meat, poultry, eggs and nuts,
which are all rich in protein. Try to eat a wide variety, especially beans,
lentils, nuts and fish, these are especially healthy for you and your family.
Meat, especially organ meats (such as liver and kidney), provide some of
the best sources of iron. Iron from meat is absorbed better than iron from
plant sources. However, liver should be taken in moderation to avoid
excess intake of vitamin A.
Choose lean varieties of meat or cut the fat off when possible, think
about limiting the amount of smoked and salt-cured sausages if you eat
these often because it is better not to eat too much salt and fat.

5. Lard, butter, margarine, oils, sugar, sweets and salt group - use
sparingly

This group includes butter, margarine, oils, lard, sugars, candies, sweet
desserts, pastry, sweetened drinks: in other words foods that have a
high fat, salt and/or sugar content.
These foods are dense in calories but provide little in the way of other
nutrients. Therefore it is better not to indulge in these products at the
expense of more nutritious foods from the other food groups.
Try to use oils (such as olive, canola or rapeseed oil) instead of animal
fats as much as possible, but if this is not possible then just try to
reduce the total amount of fat you eat.
Remember, eating a diet low in fat and, especially low in animal fat,
reduces your and your family’s risk of getting certain cancers and
cardiovascular disease - the two major “killers” of the population in
Europe .
Consume salt in moderation (up to 6 g per day in total): try to use less
salt at the table and in cooking, eat less salty or pickled foods. This will
decrease your risk of high blood pressure and related health problems.
Try whenever possible to get salt which is iodized to ensure that you
and especially your baby get enough iodine during pregnancy and
breastfeeding.

Remember these important nutrients
1. Folic acid

This vitamin is extremely important during pregnancy, especially in the
early period and even before conception.
13

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

A good intake of folate greatly increases the chance of your baby
being born without any abnormalities, thus, all women thinking about
becoming pregnant, and throughout the first 3 months of pregnancy,
should eat food sources rich in folate. Eat plenty of folate-rich foods
such as spinach, lettuce, cabbage, green beans, cauliflower and
fortified cereals.
Some women who are at particularly high risk of folate deficiency may
be advised to take a daily supplement of 400 mcg (0,4 mg) of folic acid
but you should talk to your doctor about this.
2. Iron

You need iron to form the red blood cells for you and your baby. Iron
helps to carry oxygen in your blood from the lungs to the tissues. Your
baby’s brain and body need iron and oxygen to grow.
Too little iron leads to anaemia, in which case your baby may not be
getting enough oxygen for normal growth and development.
Fortunately your ability to absorb iron increases during pregnancy and
while you are breastfeeding.
The best sources of iron are lean meats, especially liver and kidney.
Some vegetables (e.g. green leafy vegetables, cooked beans and peas)
are also a good sources of iron. To absorb more iron from vegetables
(especially beans and peas), eat foods rich in vitamin C or acidic foods
at the same time (e.g. fruits, juice, bell peppers, tomatoes, kefir,
fermented foods). Tea and coffee reduce your ability to absorb iron, so
try to drink them between meals rather than when eating iron rich
foods.
In case of extreme tiredness you may be suffering from iron
deficiency anemia. Discuss this with you doctor who may wish to
14

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

prescribe iron supplements for you. Do not take iron supplements
unless advised by the doctor. They can cause constipation and may
interfere with the absorption of other nutrients.

15

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

3. Calcium

Calcium is important for the healthy bones and teeth of both you and
your baby. The best sources of calcium are milk, dairy products and
some cereals. Try to choose low fat milk, kefir cheese and yogurt, they
provide more calcium than full fat varieties.
4. Vitamin D

Vitamin D is very important both to prevent rickets in your newborn
baby and to keep your teeth and bones healthy.
Try to spend as much time as you can outdoors, especially in sunny
weather: vitamin D is produced in your skin when you are exposed to
sunlight.
Vitamin D is found also in foods, such as oily fish, eggs, butter, and
fortified margarine. In the Northern parts of Europe with low amounts
of sunlight you may be prescribed supplements by your doctor,
especially during the winter months.

What about multivitamin supplements?
Do not take vitamin or mineral supplements unless prescribed by your
doctor. Besides being an unnecessary expense, an excessive intake of
these supplements can cause toxic effects or interfere with the
absorption of other nutrients.

What about fluids?
Drink plenty water - 6 to 8 glasses a day. Women who are
breastfeeding should drink the amount needed to satisfy their thirst.
Water, milk products and unsweetened juices are the best choices.
16

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

Limit tea and coffee to in-between meals in order not to interfere too
much with iron absorption. Try to avoid excessive amounts of
lemonade or drinks with a high sugar content, especially if you are
gaining too much weight.

Some substances may harm your baby
1. Alcohol

Try not to drink alcohol during pregnancy. An occasional glass of wine
at special events is OK.
Alcohol crosses placenta and can lead to physical, growth and mental
problems in some babies. It is especially important not to drink alcohol
at the time of conception and during the first 3 months of pregnancy
when the embryo is most vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol.
2. Smoking

Try not to smoke during pregnancy or at least try to reduce smoking
substantially. Mothers who are heavy smokers are at much higher risk
of having low birth weight babies. Smoking can also be a cause of
premature birth, miscarriage and stillbirth and may impair your child’s
growth and development.
Remember: it is never too late to stop or at least reduce smoking or
drinking. Your baby will benefit from each alcoholic drink or cigarette
you give up!
3. Caffeine

Effects of caffeine on the foetus are not well established yet. Tea,
cocoa and cola -type drinks contain about the same amount of caffeine
while coffee contains about twice as much caffeine. Try to limit your
17

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

coffee intake to 3-4 cups a day.

18

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

Remember also, that tea and coffee tend to impair your ability to
absorb iron from foods, such as beans and cereals, and iron
supplements.
4. Medications

Many medications can adversely affect your baby and are contraindicated for pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.
Consult your doctor before taking any medications, including aspirin
and vitamin supplements.

How much weight do you gain during pregnancy?
On average you should expect to gain 10-12,5 kg by the end of your
pregnancy.
Starting with the 4th month of your pregnancy you will probably gain
around 1,5-2 kg per month. Check your weight periodically and consult the
doctor if you notice you are gaining less than 1 kg or more than 3 kg per
month.
Both too little and too much weight gain can adversely affect the
health of you and your baby. Thus, make sure that you and your baby
get enough calories, but do not overeat (especially sweets and fatty
foods). Remember, “eating for two” does not mean “twice as much”.
Just follow your appetite and the healthy eating advice in this booklet.
Avoid excess under- or overeating.

If your weight before pregnancy was substantially lower or higher
than normal, ask your doctor for specialized advice on diet and
weight gain.
Remember, during your pregnancy is not a good time to go on a diet in

How to cope with the food-related problems during
pregnancy
1. Morning sickness

About 70% of women suffer from sickness, usually in early pregnancy
- around week 9-10. Later, by the end of the 4th month of pregnancy,
symptoms usually disappear or become much milder. To relieve the
symptoms of sickness, try to:
•
•
•
•

eat small but frequent meals (with about 2 hr intervals)
avoid smells and foods that make your sickness worse
eat more nutritious carbohydrate foods: try dry toasts or
crackers, breakfast cereals, fruits and vegetable salads at any
time during the day
eat less fatty and sugary foods

2. Constipation

35-40% of pregnant women suffer from constipation during
pregnancy.
How to deal with the problem:
•
•

drink plenty of fluid such as plain water (6-8 cups a day)
increase intake of foods rich in fiber (wholemeal bread, brown
rice, wholegrain cereals, fresh and dried vegetables and fruits,
especially prunes and figs)

Remember, iron supplements can sometimes cause or aggravate the
symptoms of constipation. If you are taking iron supplements and
20

notice that the symptoms of constipation progress, consult your doctor.

3. Heartburn

May occur anytime during pregnancy, but symptoms usually get worse
at the end of pregnancy. Also a common problem - about 30-50% of
pregnant women suffer from heartburn.
Some suggestions on how to deal with the problem:
•

•
•
•
•
•

avoid chocolate, fatty foods, alcohol and mint, especially
before bedtime - they tend to relax oesophageal muscle so that
acid from the stomach regurgitates up into the oesophagus
more easily
avoid acidic and spicy foods that may irritate mucosa (tomato,
citrus fruits and juices, vinegar, hot pepper, etc.)
milk and dairy products can temporarily relieve the symptoms
of heartburn
eat slowly, drink fluids between meals rather than with meals
eat small frequent meals, do not eat large meals before
bedtime
sleep well propped up, not lying flat

Remember to consult your doctor before taking antacid medications.
Some antacids can bind iron in foods and make iron unavailable for you
to absorb.

Guidelines for successful breastfeeding
Breastfeeding can be a wonderful experience both for you and your
baby.
Remember:
•

breast milk is by far the best food for your newborn baby; no
22

Healthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
_____________________________________________________________________
_

•
•
•
•

•
•
•

commercial-made baby formula as well as any other food or drink
can match breast milk;
breastfeeding (as compared to artificial feeding) protects against
common infections, especially diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases as
well as urinary tract and ear infections;
breastfeed as often as baby wants, do not restrict frequency of
feeding according to a timetable;
let the baby come off the breast spontaneously, do not take baby off
the breast before the baby is finished;
try to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months and then continue for as
long and often as possible (exclusively means giving your baby
only breastmilk for 6 months – no other fluids, including water,
tea or glucose!);
anaemia is not a contra-indication to breastfeeding and even if
you are anaemic you should continue to breast feed;
weight loss is not a contra-indication to breastfeeding and even
if you have lost weight you should continue to breast feed;
you should not stop breastfeeding even if you are smoking or
occasionally consume alcohol – your milk is still the best food
for your baby.

You can get more information on breastfeeding from a WHO booklet
for mothers on infant feeding (available on internet:
http://www.who.dk/Nutrition/main.htm).

Healthy eating for women who are breastfeeding
After birth you will probably be about 3-4 kg over your pre-pregnant
weight. Don’t try to lose weight immediately – since these stores are
used to make breast milk. Breast milk production itself demands a lot
of energy - so breastfeeding will help you to get back to a normal
weight.

23

The principles of healthy nutrition recommended for pregnancy apply
also during breastfeeding.

Remember:
•
•
•
•
•

•

alcohol can pass into the breast milk, so do not drink or at least
restrict alcohol intake during lactation;
there is no evidence of any beneficial effect of alcohol on
breast milk production;
smoking may decrease your ability to produce breast milk and
thus affect the growth of your baby, smoking also decreases
the vitamin C content in breast milk;
try not to harm the lungs of your newborn child - never smoke
in baby’s room;
caffeine can pass into the breast milk and cause hyperactivity
and sleeping problems in your baby - try not to drink too much
coffee, tea and cola drinks (recommendations are the same as
for pregnancy);
many medications can also pass into breast milk - check with
your doctor before taking any (however, taking most
medications is not a contraindication to a breastfeeding)

Tips on food safety and preparation
During pregnancy and breastfeeding you should be particularly careful
about not getting an infection from contaminated food products.
Some bacteria and parasites can be harmful to your unborn baby.
•
•
•
•

do not eat raw or undercooked eggs: eggs must be well
cooked so that both white and yolk are hard;
avoid home-made pates or pates that are not canned;
avoid unpasteurized ice creams and unpasteurized (or
unboiled) milk;
thoroughly cook meat and poultry; make sure the frozen meats
are defrosted properly before cooking;

store raw meat in the refrigerator so that it does not drip and
contaminate other foods; wash your hands and kitchen
surfaces after handling meat;
thoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables;
to preserve vitamins boil vegetables in a minimum amount of
water, do not overcook; try cooking over steam or
microwaving (if you have a microwave);
if you use microwave, follow manufacturer’s instructions and
make sure that food is cooked right through to the centre;
check the use-by date on the food package;
wear gloves when gardening and wash hands afterwards;

avoid contact with cats, use gloves when handling cat
excrements: cats can be the source of Toxoplasmosis serious infection that can cause blindness, mental retardation
or even intrauterine death of the foetus.

Nutrition Education for Lactating Mothers

and Weaning-Age Infants in Bangladesh:
Policy Implications of an Evaluation
Under what conditions can
nutrition education reach women
and children in developing
countries and contribute to
improvements in their nutritional
status?
A recent evaluation of a nutrition
education effort in rural Bangladesh
suggests that improving the diets of
lactating women requires both
education and increases in family
income. Women in the study
responded to the nutrition
messages and wanted to improve
the quantity and quality of food in
their diets, but their families were
unable to make substantial
increases in expenditures for food.
I lowever, families were able to
make smaller expenditures to add
weaning fxods to children's diets
and improve their nutritional status,
The evaluation confirmed previous
research showing that culturallyappropriate nutrition messages can
change infant feeding practices,
even in a conservative culture
where poverty is extreme.
The major policy
recommendations are:
e

That nutrition education to
improve women's diets be
incorporated into programs that
make these improvements
affordable, such as women's
saving groups, incomegenerating projects, agricultural
production, home gardens, or
subsidized or donated food
programs;

e That nutrition education to
improve the diets of weaningage children encourage families
to provide hygienic,
complementary feeding of
simple, low-cost, energy-rich

food to breastfed infants over
four to six months of age. This
education can be effective with
or without other program
supports.

The Nutrition Education
Interventioris
To improve the nutrition of
mothers and infants, the
Bangladesh Rural Advancement
Committee (BRAC) and Tufts
University conducted two nutrition
education interventions in rural
Bangladesh in 1987. The
intervention site included five
villages with a total population of
approximately 12,000. The villages
were without electricity, isolated
from transportation networks, and
had no other development
programs. Eight village workers
(five female and three male) and
one male supervisor initiated
intervention activities. They
reviewed community responses to a
nutritional needs assessment,
brainstormed with technical staff
and conducted in-home problem
diagnoses and behavioral-change
trials to develop persuasive and
practical nutrition messages. After
testing messages in their own
homes, village workers trained
volunteer mothers, who further
refined the messages with their own
children and then disseminated the
messages to other village mothers.
Since Bangladeshi mothers have
limited control over their food
budgets and portions, the approach
was family-oriented. Messages
appealed to the family's desire for
strong, healthy children; they were
feasible, specific, motivating, and
memorable. Only education was
given (no food supplements).

To improve the diets of lactating
women so they could adequately
breastfeed, the village workers
trained volunteers with infants
under six months of age to
disseminate messages to other
families with young infants. The

Village workers trained other
volunteers to disseminate messages
aimed at encouraging families to
improve the diets of children six to
twelve months of age. The
volunteer mothers conducted in­
home demonstrations of snack-type

messages encouraged the mothers
to eat an extra serving of all foods
they were eating at meals, to
increase fluid intake, to use good
hygiene practices and to offer both
breasts to the baby at each feeding.
(See Figure 1.) This lactation
intervention reached 48 mothers
(lactation intervention treatment
group).

recipes and techniques to enrich
foods from the family pot. The
messages stressed food hygiene and
encouraged both breastfeeding and
the introduction of new foods.
(See Figure 2.) Through this
weaning intervention, volunteers
reached the children of 62 mothers
(weaning intervention treatment
group).

to increase the share given to all
family members. The woman's
share alone would require an
additional cost of 21 percent of the
daily wage for an agricultural
laborer; increasing food allocations
to other family members would be
even more costly. Family budgets
were too tight to permit such
increased expenditures for food.
Typically, women eat last, and are
trained to be self-sacrificing.
Lactating mothers felt
uncomfortable about taking more
food for themselves than they
served to others. In many cases,
the option of taking more for
themselves did not even exist; there
simply was no more food.

Mothers were philosophical:
'"hen we have food, we eat it;
when we don't, we don't." They
realized that when they ate "good
food," they had more breastmilk,
but they were unable to acquire
more food. The message they liked
best was: "Drink eight or more
glasses of water a day and you will
have more milk." They could
comply with this message without
spending money. In fact, many
women believed that good health
was only attainable by the wealthy.
Their husbands were frank about
,he financial realities: "We are poor
and cannot afford more food." In
fact, in a sampling of households
interviewed, weekly food
expenditures were already greater
than weekly income. When asked
how this was possible, most men
revealed they were constantly taking
out loans from neighbors, and, if
possible, from banks. Most of the
men were very thin themselves,
suggesting they too were getting
less than their required level of
food.
Men varied in their receptiveness
to education about the nutritional
needs of their wives. Some did not
see nutrition as being within the
scope of their responsibilities. "The
father's duty is to make the income
and bring the food," they said. "The
mother's duty is to care for the
child and inform the father of the
child's needs (e.g. medicine)." Most
of the men were not willing to
teach other men about nutrition,
except for informal discussions at
the market or mosque.
Lactating mothers who received
nutrition educatioa were less
likely to have children who
became severely malnourished

than mothers in the control
group; however there were no
significant differences in overall
child nutritional status or growth
rates.
At baseline, there were no
significant differences in nutritional
status between the infants, of
women receiving the education and
those in the control group. Th:­
average nutritional status of both
groups deteriorated during the
study (as measured by the infant's
weight for age and arm
circumference) and at the final
measure there were no significant
differences between the two
groups. Ilowever, differences in
levels of severe malnutrition did
occur. In the control group, the
number of infants who became
severely malnourished increased
significantly. In the treatment
group, the number of infants
becoming malnourished also
increased, but the level of increase
was not statistically significant.
These slight differences suggest that
education may have helped to
prevent severe malnutrition.

Findings: The Weaning
Intervention
Children in families that received
education on complementary
(weaning) foods grew
significantly better than children
in co ntro l fam ilies.
At baseline in May, the average
child in both treatment and control
groups was moderately

The extra food consumed by the
children itt the treatment group was
insufficient to meet increasing
energy requirements as the child
grew older and breastmilk intake
decreased. Therefore, the energy
adequacy of the total diet
(including estimates of the amount
of breastmilk consumed by the
child) decreased for both groups
over the study period. The decline

end of the intervention, breastmilk
still provided the major amount of
the children's protein.
Adding complementary foods to
improve the adequacy of the
children's diets was affordable, cven
in poor families (except for
expensive animal foods). The
actual weight gains achieved over
the five-month, critical weaning
period were attained for only two
percent of the daily wage. These
gains were less than ideal, but the
breastfeeding infant's energy gap
could potentially be closed for
three to ten percent or the daily
wage (depending on age),
considerably less than the cost of
improving the lactating mother's
diet. (See Figure 7.)

Among children in the treatment
group, the percent of the child's
protein requirement contributed by
complementary foods increased
during the course of the
intervention; for the children in the

the groups was significant, and was

primarily due to an increase in the
amount of the weaning fooc

The amount of animal protein in
the children's diets declined for
both groups, due to a reduction in

cow's or goat's milk offered as the
children made the transition from a
liquid diet to the grain-based family
diet. However, the decline was less
for the treatment group, since more
of these families incorporated small

Policy Recommendations
From the experience of this
nutrition education program in

rural Bangladesh, what guidance
can be derived for planning and
implementing other nutrition
cducation programs? Eight major
recommendation! are listed and
explained below,

1. Incorporate natrition
education for improving
women's diets into programs
that make these
iml 'rovements a!fordable,

Cofdlthof rn Buglades
In Bangladesh, many conditions limit opportunities to
achieve good health and proper nutritior,. People ate
vecy poor. Food shortages occur seasonally and few
technologies exist for preserving food in the tropical
climate. Overpopulation, poor sanitation, and a poorly
functioning health infrastructure add further difficulties.
Women have very low status; 80 percent have never

been to school, and cannot read, write or understand
numbers. Widesrread m.,cmal undernutrition is
reflected in the fact that more than o.o-qua'ter of all
newborns are born with low birth weight. Childhood

In ruidi areas, mothers breastfeed their children for two,
and sometimes three, years. Breast-nilk provides
substantial amounts of tho energy (calories), protein,
vitamin A, and other nutrients for children up to age two
or three, but by the time the child is six months old, the

Most of the women in this study

quality of their diets, but fe't

constraints were paramount. In

order to consume an adequate diet
using low cost foods, the lactating
women would need to ijearly
double their food budgets--an
additional cost of 2 1 pe'ceit of the
daily wage. In reality, thes-e costs

quantities are grossly insufficient. This is in part due to
the poorly nourished state of the mothers. Traditionally,
Bangladeshi women do not persistently encourage their
infants to eat other foods until about 18 months of age.
No traditionnl weaning mixtures exist; the first foods

Although the study focused on
lactating women, the conclusions
can be generalized to all women of
childbearing age, including
adolescents and pregnant women.

confined to the honme and spead their days cooking,
cleaning, and caring for children and elders. They have
no control over the food supply budget. It is men who
harvest and buy and sell food in the market.
These conditions illustrate the extent to which cultural
and economic barriers make it difficult for families to
meet the nutritional needs of women and weaning-age

children.

Even participation in incomegenerating programs and women's
savings groups, and acquiring
access to money would not result
automatically in women improving
their own diets. Experience with
such programs in Bangladesh
suggests that many women have
achieved savings, but still don't
spend money on themselves. Since
Bangladeshi women are taught
throughout their lives to be selfsacrificing, they may need to learn
to spend money on themselves,
2. En''ourage families to provide
hygienic, complementary
feeding of simple, low-cost,
energy-rich food to breastfed
infants over four to six
months of age.
In the Bangladesh context, the
breastfeeding infant's diet could be
improved with a low-cost weaning
food for about one-third of the
additional cost for inproving a
lactating woman's diet, or less than
8 percent of the daily wage .
Improving the infant's diet is
feasible because. 1) family
members, especially mothers, have
control over the child's diet; 2)
investing in children is valued; 3)
only small amounts of additional
food are needed because breastmilk
provides the bulk of the young
child's diet.
This intervention has shown that,
under conditions of extreme
poverty and pocr sanitation (such
as those observed in rural
Bangladesh), nutrition education
alone can only prevent further
deterioration in nutritional status.
However, it will not be sufficient to
bring the c! Iren up to the
internationai standards unless
socioeconomic conditions are

improved. Integrating nutrition
education with other income­
generating or food-production
programs increases the potential for
change.
3. Conduct village-level research
to design appropriate
messages for nutrition
education.
Village-level research can be very
helpful in designing appropriate
messages. This research should be
conducted before wide-scale project
implementation, to ensure that
messages are appropriate,
affordable, and understood by the
recipients. Effective nutrition
education involves much more than
memorization of carefully-worded
messages. The words simply
express a concept; the educational
process must effectively promote
t.,e behavior communicated by the
message. For e:xample, village
workers who helped design the
messages in this study, preferred
catchy, poetic phrases, considering
them to be "sbundor"(beautiful), a
valued virtue in Bangladesh culture.
Initially, the workers tried to teach
the mothers to repeat, verbatim, the
beautiful rhythmic messages.
In so doing, the focus was on
memorization, not actual practice of
the content of the message. After
discussion, the village workers
decided to ask mothers to repeat
only the sense of the message, and
not the poetry in totality. "The real
test of the message was whether it
was practiced."
The messages must be based on
sound knowledge of foods
consumed and local cultural beliefs
and practices. A widely-held
perception in this setting that
children are not fed complementary

12

foods until w ell into their second
year was not an accurate
description of practice. Through
probing and observation, village
workers discovered that many
families offer bits and pieces of a
variety of appropriate weaning

snacks might evade some cultural
barriers, but cost would still be a
barrier. The cost of improving
women's diets is the same, whether
promoted through snacks or meals.

6. Design strategies to help
caretakers deal with feeding
problems in young children
and prevent and control
infections.

5. Train village-level workers to
demonstrate food preparation
methods and to model
expected behaviors.

One of the most common reasons
reported for not giving more
complementary food was because
"the child refused." One budget
conscious father, impatient with the
time often needed for normal child
feeding development, became very
angry when he purchased the
ingredients for a snack food, only
to have the child spit it out. A
reality of child development is that
no matter how nutritious, misty, and
appropriate a food, one can never
guarantee that a child will eat it.

The lactation and weaning
interventions involved recipients in
the development of appropriate
messages. Families learned best by
observing other families practicing
the messages. Both interventions
used the same educational
approach, but the weaning food
messages demanded more active
participation by recipients, for
example, through the preparation
of special recipes. The messages of
the lactation intervention
encouraged "more" of what the
women were already doing. The
success of the weaning food
messages may lie in part with the
fact that they were not too timeconsuming, and demanded active
participation, thus were more

Why do children not demand and
consume sufficie.nt quantities of
food to sustain normal growth?
One of the many reasons appears to
be illness. Children experience
frequent acute infectious episodes
and many have underlying chronic
illnesses. Studies in a similar

setting suggest that on sick days,

children in developing countries
consume at least 20-30 percent
fewer calories, a deficit that is often
not made up when the child
recovers. Furthermore, cultural
beliefs encourage the withholding
of food during illness. Programs to
prevent and control infections in
young children are likely to create a
more positive feeding environment,
with better food intakes, improved
growth, and more effective
compliance with nutrition
education.

women.
Investments in formal and
nonformal education for women
may also be seen as supporting
improved nutrition. Many studies
have documented the link between
maternal education and child
health. In this study, a woman's
exposure to formal education, even
after controlling for wealth, was a
significant predictor of the

nutritional adequacy of her diet
(energy intake) and in the weaning
intervention, wa-s predictive of the
child's nutritional status and weight
gain.

8. Engage fathers and other
family member. in the issues
of intrafamily food
distribution.
Traditional adult diets in rural
Bangladesh are already about as
low cost as possible with over 80
percent of the calories from grain,
and little or no animal foods. In
the families participating in this
study, all household members

appeared to suffer from lack of
adequate food. Education to
change food choices for women
will likely be futile unless money is
available to increase nutrition for all
family members. Thus, approaches
must focus on all members of the
family, and not just on women and
children.

Conclusions
An evaluation of two nutrition
education interventions in rural
Bangladesh confirms that culturally­
appropriate nutrition messages can
change infant feeding practices and
improve the nutritional status of
children. These changes can be
affordable, even to poor families.
However, the evaluation raises
concerns about the effectiveness of
nutrition education in improving
women's diets unless financial
barriers are also addressed. For
both women and children, existing
patterns of nutrition are intricately
connected to cultural beliefs and
practices. Thus, designing effective
programs requires attention to both
cultural and economic realities.

Introduction

6   UNICEF Programming Guidance

The right to adequate nutrition is a fundamental right
for every child. Children who are fed enough of the
right foods, in the right way, at the right time in their
development, are more likely to survive, grow, develop
and learn. They are better equipped to thrive, even
when faced with disease, disaster or crisis.
Between the ages of 6 and 23 months – the
complementary feeding period – breastfeeding and
access to a diverse range of nutritious foods provide
children with the essential nutrients, vitamins, and
minerals they need to develop to their full physical
and cognitive potential, with benefits that endure well
into adulthood.1, 2 The complementary feeding period
is also a critical opportunity to prevent all forms of
childhood malnutrition, including stunting, wasting,
micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity and
diet-related non-communicable diseases. In addition,
lifelong food preferences, tastes and habits are often
established in childhood.
Yet in nearly every part of the world, families face
economic, political, market, social or cultural barriers
to providing nutritious, safe, affordable and sustainable
diets to young children. These challenges are
exacerbated in humanitarian situations, where access
to nutritious food, clean drinking water, and good
quality health services are limited, and the resources
and capacities of caregivers already stretched. Young
children and their caregivers are increasingly exposed
to foods of low nutritive value, including commercial
complementary foods and processed foods high in
added sugar, salt and saturated and trans fats that are
inexpensive, ubiquitous, and easy to feed to young
children. 3 Accelerating progress to improve the quality
of complementary foods and feeding practices for
young children is therefore critical.4

This Programming Guidance, Improving Young
Children’s Diets During the Complementary Feeding
Period,* supports global efforts to improve the diets
of children aged 6–23 months in all contexts.** It is
intended for use by UNICEF staff in programmes such
as nutrition, health, early childhood development,
water, sanitation and hygiene and social policy – in
regional, country and field offices – to support the
work of governments and partner organizations.
Previous UNICEF guidance on infant and young
child feeding focused mainly on evidencebased interventions and strategies for improving
complementary feeding practices within the
household.5 This Programming Guidance goes beyond
feeding practices to articulate interventions and
approaches for improving the availability, accessibility,
affordability and consumption of nutritious and safe
complementary foods. In addition, this Programming
Guidance describes the most recent evidence on
improving complementary feeding, explores the
determinants and drivers of young children’s diets, and
presents action frameworks for delivering nutrition
results for children through the food, health, water
and sanitation, and social protection systems. It also
provides guidance on monitoring and evaluating
complementary feeding programmes and outcomes.

* The terms complementary foods/feeding and diets for young children are used interchangeably in this document.

Why children’s
diets matter
during the
complementary
feeding period

8   UNICEF Programming Guidance

The quality of children’s diets is more important
before age 2 than at any other time in life.4, 6
Appropriate complementary foods and feeding
practices contribute to child survival, growth and
development; they can also prevent micronutrient
deficiencies, morbidity and obesity later in life.
The complementary feeding period, from 6 to 23
months of age, is one of the most challenging times
to meet children’s nutrient demands. While children’s
stomachs can only hold a small amount of food, their
nutrient needs reach a lifetime peak,7 leaving them
vulnerable to growth faltering. In most countries,
declines in height-for-age or length-for-age (HAZ
or LAZ) occur primarily during the complementary
feeding period (Figure 1)1, 8 due to the inadequate
quality and/or quantity of first foods, poor feeding
practices and increased rates of infection.9, 10
While first foods should be nutrient-rich, young
children are often fed meals based mainly on
staple cereals and grains, which are low in energy,
protein, iron, zinc and other essential nutrients.11-14
Unhygienic feeding practices also increase the risk
of infections and diarrhoea 4, 6 in young children,
which, when combined with poor diets, can lead to
growth failure.15
The most recent global estimates of complementary
feeding practices – based on indicators established
by WHO – highlight a worrying situation. In lowand middle-income countries, half of all children
are not receiving the minimum meal frequency
(the minimum number of meals throughout the
day needed to meet their nutrient needs); more
than two thirds of children are not receiving the
minimum dietary diversity (meals from a minimum
number of food groups); and five out of six children
are not receiving a minimum acceptable diet (both
the minimum meal frequency and minimum dietary
diversity needed to reduce the risk of malnutrition)
(Figure 2).16 Diet quality is associated with nutrition
status: children who are fed at least a minimum

acceptable diet are less likely to be stunted or
underweight.17-19
Despite widespread consensus on the importance
of good nutrition in early life, an alarming number of
young children are suffering the consequences of
poor diets. At least one in three children under 5 is
either undernourished or overweight, according to
the State of the World’s Children 2019: Children, food
and nutrition. Stunting affects 149 million children
under 5 worldwide,4, 20 diminishing their physical
and cognitive growth and development.20 Children
affected by stunting often grow up to be stunted
adults themselves,21 and stunted mothers are more
likely to have stunted children. Wasting affects more
than 49 million children under 5 globally, putting them
at increased risk of infection and death.20, 22 Indeed,
undernutrition is responsible for up to 45 percent of
deaths in children under 5 and is a significant cause
of morbidity in this age group.22 At the same time,
childhood overweight impacts at least 40 million
children under 5, and is likely to continue rising in lowand middle-income countries, increasing the risk of
non-communicable diseases in adulthood.20, 23, 24

Figure 1: Growth faltering in height for age (HAZ) in
children coincides with the complementary feeding
period 8

Poor child growth in the first 1,000 days from
conception to age 2 predicts poorer survival 22, 25 and
increases the risk of obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases in adulthood. It also reduces
cognitive and educational outcomes 26 and leads to
income losses later in life.22, 27 Stunted children may
earn 20 per cent less than adults compared with
their non-stunted peers,28, 29 and stunting can reduce
a country’s gross domestic product by up to 3 per
cent.29 Stunting and child growth deficits are difficult
to reverse, while cognitive deficits may be permanent
after two years.7

Improving children’s diets is the foundation of
sustainable and prosperous societies and paramount
to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), including Goal 2 to improve nutrition and end
all forms of malnutrition. Improving children’s nutrition
also supports the achievement of SDG targets on
ending preventable childhood deaths and eliminating
poverty, among others. Lastly, improving children’s
diets is central to addressing three of the six World
Health Assembly (WHA) targets for reducing stunting,
wasting and childhood overweight by 2025.

Dimensions
of children’s
diets during the
complementary
feeding period

Improving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period   11

During the complementary feeding period, the
quality of children’s diets is determined by the foods
that children eat and the feeding behaviours of their
caregivers. This section outlines what children should
eat between the ages of 6 and 23 months; and when
and how they should be fed by their caregivers to
meet their nutrient requirements for growth and
development.* It also outlines the key underlying
factors that influence optimal feeding behaviours,
such as food availability, accessibility, affordability and
sustainability, and the supporting evidence regarding
these dimensions.
3.1 WHAT CHILDREN E AT

WHO and UNICEF recommend that infants be
exclusively breastfed from birth to 6 months of age.
At 6 months, children should be introduced to ageappropriate, nutritious and safe complementary foods,
alongside continued breastfeeding. An adequate diet
during the complementary feeding period should be
nutrient rich, without excess energy, saturated and
trans fats, free sugars or salt.
Adequate diets for young children during
the complementary feeding period are
characterized by:
3.1.1 Dietary diversity: Young children need to
consume a variety of foods to meet their nutrient
needs and expose them to various tastes and
textures. A diverse diet includes meals consisting
of foods from a variety of food groups each day: (1)
breastmilk; (2) grains, roots and tubers; (3) legumes,
nuts and seeds; (4) dairy (milk, yoghurt, cheese);
(5) flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, and liver or
organ meats); (6) eggs; (7) vitamin A-rich fruits and
vegetables (carrots, mangoes, dark green leafy
vegetables, pumpkins, orange sweet potato); and (8)
other fruits and vegetables. Children who are fed a

are underway to update the WHO guiding principles for complementary feeding; however, few changes are expected following this update.
12   UNICEF Programming Guidance

diverse range of foods are more likely to meet their
micronutrient requirements, including the need for
vitamin A, iron, calcium, thiamine, folate, zinc, vitamins
B6 and B12.30-33
3.1.2 Nutrient density: Young children have limited
stomach capacity and must therefore eat small,
nutrient-rich meals to maximize the nutrition in each
bite. Examples of nutrient-dense local foods include
meat, eggs and other animal-source foods and
legumes, such as groundnuts. Cereals or plant-based
porridges may appease hunger, but alone they do not
provide sufficient energy, protein and micronutrients to
fill the gap between breastmilk and the child’s nutrient
requirements.34 The quality of fat in children’s diets is
important:35 Long-chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids –
especially omega 3 fatty acids, which are found in fish
(such as trout, mackerel and sardines), seafood, nuts,
seeds, soy bean and plant oils – promote cognitive
and motor development in children.36 Trans fats, often
found in processed foods, should be avoided given their
link to inflammation in children and chronic diseases in
adults.37 Nutrient-rich and energy-rich foods should be
fed in age-appropriate and not excessive portions.
3.1.3 Inclusion of animal-source foods, vegetables
and fruits: Animal-source foods (such as eggs,
meat, poultry, fish and dairy) are a good source of
high-quality protein and essential fatty acids and they
should be introduced early, as some of the first foods
that children eat. They are also an important source
of key nutrients, such as zinc, iron,** vitamin B12 and
calcium.38, 39 Emerging evidence shows that the
consumption of at least five food groups, including
animal-source foods, is associated with a reduced
risk of stunting in young children.19, 40 Fruits and
vegetables are vital components of a nutritious diet
and a rich source of vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre
and antioxidants.41 Consuming a variety of fruits and
vegetables daily helps ensure an adequate intake of
many essential nutrients.
** With the exception of egg and dairy, which are not good sources of
iron.

3.1.4 Inclusion of fortified foods or vitamin and
mineral supplements, as needed: While nutrientrich, home-prepared, and locally available foods are
always preferable,42 it can be difficult to meet young
children’s nutrient needs in settings plagued by food
insecurity or humanitarian crisis, and in settings with
predominantly vegetarian diets. In these contexts,
foods fortified with vitamins and minerals that contain
iron can fill nutrient gaps, and micronutrient powders
(MNPs) can be added to enhance the quality of foods
prepared at home (see section 5.4).43 Commercial
fortified foods for infants and young children (e.g.,
vitamin or mineral-enriched cereals) can also be an
important source of micronutrients in some contexts.
The promotion of affordable fortified complementary
foods should always be undertaken in line with
national and global standards (i.e., the International
Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and
WHA Resolution 69.9).44
3.1.5 Avoidance of foods and beverages of low
nutrient value: Caregivers should avoid providing
drinks or foods with low nutritional value, such
as sugar-sweetened beverages, candy, chips and
other foods high in sugar, salt and trans fats. These
‘junk’ foods contribute little more than energy, while
displacing breastmilk and decreasing the child’s
appetite for more nutritious foods. The consumption
of sugar-sweetened beverages by young children is
associated with increased weight gain, body mass
index (BMI) and risk of overweight and obesity.45
Fruit juices, especially processed ones, should also
be consumed in moderation as they are often rich in
added sugars. Commercial complementary foods tend
to have the same (sweet) taste and texture, and when

consumed regularly, can make children less interested
in trying family foods and experiencing new tastes
and textures. Spotlight 1 presents growing evidence
on the inappropriate promotion of commercial
complementary foods for young children.
3.1.6 Avoidance of added sugars: In many contexts,
caregivers add sugar to foods and beverages prepared
at home to improve the taste. Sugar can contribute
to excess energy intake and cause dental caries. The
consumption of sweet foods also contributes to a
preference for such foods, with the potential to set
lifelong taste preferences for sugar.
3.1.7 Continued breastfeeding: Children should
continue frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until
2 years of age or longer. Continued breastfeeding
throughout the complementary feeding period
provides essential fats, proteins and other nutrients
that are important in all settings. Evidence shows
that children aged 6–23 months who do not receive
breastmilk have a higher risk of all-cause mortality and
infection-related mortality compared with breastfed
children.46 Studies in high income countries have
shown that breastfeeding beyond 4 months of age is
associated with a lower risk of child overweight and
obesity.47-49 Breastfeeding is also associated with
improved cognitive development.50 Children who
are not breastfed during the complementary feeding
period should be fed dairy products such as animal
milk, fermented milk or yoghurt. The use of follow-up
formulas or growing up milks are not necessary and
are often too high in sugars such as corn syrup solids
or other added caloric sweeteners.51

Spotlight 1

Unpacking the concerns
with commercial foods
for young children 52
Sales of commercial baby and toddler
foods have grown rapidly in recent
years.53 The role of these products
in appropriate complementary
feeding has been widely debated.54
However, there is a growing body
of evidence that the promotion of
commercial foods for infants and young children has the potential undermine optimal nutrition during the
complementary feeding period. These concerns are summarized below:
Nutritional composition
The levels of saturated or transfats, free sugars and salt in
some commercially-produced
baby food is too high and may
predispose the child to noncommunicable diseases.55-62
Artificial sweeteners and other
food additives in baby food are
also linked with health concerns
as they may encourage greater
sugar consumption later in life.63
Flavour and texture
The overwhelmingly sweet
taste of commercial foods for
young children can influence
later taste preferences and
habits.64-66 Fruit puree is often the
main ingredient in such foods,
and even ostensibly savoury or
vegetable-based products list
fruit as the first ingredient by
volume. Given that the sweet
fruit flavours mask the taste
of the vegetable components,
it has been argued that a less
sweet product mix would help
babies accept and like a wider
variety of flavours. 34 Similarly,
there are concerns about the
introduction of salty tastes to
young palates, as well as flavours
not typically used in homemade
foods or recommended in dietary
guidelines for young children
(e.g. chocolate or vanilla).
The provision of food in pouches
can encourage children to
suck the food directly from the
nozzle of the pouch (even if this
is not recommended by the

14   UNICEF Programming Guidance

manufacturer). The ease and
speed of feeding in this way may
cause children to consume too
many calories too quickly and
could lead to dental caries.67
Many commercial baby and
toddler foods are very smooth
in consistency.61 Because these
foods are marketed without
an upper age limit, they do
not encourage progression to
foods with different textures.68
They also lack the authentic
taste, texture and appearance
of simple homemade foods and
can negatively influence the
acceptance of such foods later in
childhood.57
Some products on the market,
such as biscuits, wafers, puffs,
bars, bites and fruit shapes,
encourage snacking and their
marketing often positions them
as an expected and appropriate
part of a child’s diet; however, in
many ways, they are nutritionally
similar to confectionery. 34
Inappropriate marketing
The promotion of commercial
foods for infants and young
children may undermine
exclusive and continued
breastfeeding by encouraging
the introduction of these foods
before 6 months of age or
inferring that they are superior
to breastmilk. Many products on
the market indicate on the label
that they are suitable for infants
younger than 6 months and

contain a variety of nutrition and
health claims, which contravene
UNICEF/WHO recommendations
and Codex Alimentarius
guidelines.69 Some of these
products are marketed using
brands, labels and packaging that
are very similar to those used for
infant formula, thereby indirectly
promoting these breastmilk
substitutes (known as cross
promotion).
The marketing of commercial
foods for infants and young
children can undermine the value
of home-prepared foods (which
are usually less expensive),
discourage caregivers from
feeding children a diverse diet,
and create dependency on
commercial products. It can
also undermine caregivers’
confidence that a diet based on
home-prepared foods will result
in the same health or educational
outcomes.
Further information is available
in the WHO Guidance on Ending
the Inappropriate Promotion
of Foods for Infants and Young
Children (Spotlight 4).

3.2.3 Age-appropriate amounts: Caregivers should
introduce children to small amounts of food at first and
increase the quantity of each meal gradually as the
child gets older. The recommended age-appropriate
amounts per meal for breastfed and non-breastfed
children are as follows:42

3. 2 WHEN AND HOW CHILDREN ARE FED

3.2.1 Timely introduction of first foods: At 6
months of age, children should be introduced to
their first soft, semi-solid or solid foods.42 Timely
introduction of first foods is critical, as breastmilk
alone is no longer sufficient to meet a child’s
requirements for optimal growth and development.34
3.2.2 Age-appropriate meal frequency: Caregivers
should increase the number of meals fed to children
throughout the day as they get older. The appropriate
number of feedings depends on the energy density of
the food and the quantities consumed at each feeding.
WHO recommends the following minimum meal
frequency for an average healthy child:* 5, 70
• Two meals a day of solid, semi-solid or soft foods
for breastfed infants aged 6–8 months;
• Three meals a day of solid, semi-solid or soft foods
for breastfed children aged 9–23 months;
• Four meals a day of solid, semi-solid or soft foods
(or milk feeds) for non-breastfed children aged 6–23
months, of which at least one meal must include
solid, semi-solid or soft food.33

* Milk feeds are not included as a meal for breastfed children because the recommended frequency is based on an assumed average
breastmilk intake. Caregivers can offer one or two healthy snacks to
the child, such as a piece of fruit, while exercising caution to avoid
displacing breastmilk in the child’s diet.

• Begin with 2–3 teaspoons of food and transition
to about ½ cup** per meal for children aged 6–8
months.
• Provide ½ cup per meal to children aged 9–11
months.
• Provide ¾ cup to 1 cup per meal to children aged
12–23 months.
3.2.4 Age-appropriate food consistency: The
consistency of food should gradually evolve (from soft
to semi-solid to solid) with age, according to the child’s
requirements and abilities. Young children move from
eating mashed foods, to finger foods, to family foods
by the time they reach their first year. Inappropriate
consistency can compromise nutrient intake, as
children may only be able to consume a trivial
amount. At the same time, diluting complementary
foods to reduce viscosity can also lower their energy
density,71 which is an increasing concern with the
rise of pureed food pouches (see Spotlight 1). While
pureed foods are needed for children with special
needs (e.g., those with disabilities or developmental
delays that make eating and drinking difficult), in most
cases, the extended use of pureed foods can delay
** One cup of food is approximately 250 ml.

Considering the needs of children and caregivers with disabilities
during the complementary feeding period
Malnutrition can cause disabilities and disability can also lead to malnutrition, creating a vicious cycle.80
Some children with disabilities are more likely to be malnourished due to difficulties in swallowing and
feeding, frequent illness, difficulties in absorbing nutrients, lack of caregiver knowledge on feeding, and
neglect.81
Physical challenges with feeding may make
mealtimes longer and require assistive devices
and implements, such as mortars, food mills,
blenders and other manual food processors used to
make soft pureed foods. Caregivers may therefore
require training and support to be able to feed their
children safely and appropriately. For example, a
stable, upright position with support for eating and
drinking is one of the most important factors for
safe swallowing. Wedged pillows or corner chairs,
made by local carpenters, can facilitate this position
during mealtimes. 82 Spoons and forks with a fold
or thicker handle are easier for children to hold and
bring to their mouths, while a plate with steep sides
makes eating easier for children who are blind or
have mobility limitations as the edges help push the
food on to the spoon or fork.

such as modified food consistency. 83 These barriers
are compounded when the caregiver also has a
disability.

Children with disabilities are more likely to be
overlooked in mainstream programmes and
services. Situational analysis should therefore
specifically consider the needs and rights of
children with disabilities – with a systematic
examination of the status, trends and determinants
of poor diets for children with disabilities – in order
to provide targeted support.
Households headed by people with disabilities
often face barriers in accessing livelihoods and
income-generating activities, affecting their
food security and making it challenging to afford
nutritious complementary foods. To address these
situations, social protection programmes should
be targeted to include children and caregivers with
disabilities. In addition, mobility may be limited for
some children or caregivers living with disabilities,
restricting their ability to seek services, information,
counselling, and support, particularly where
community extension services are limited.
Caregivers and children with disabilities in
humanitarian crises face unique challenges. They
may not benefit from food distributions, food-forwork, or livelihoods programmes, which further
limits their access to nutritious food. Food rations
may also not accommodate special feeding needs,

the consumption of foods with varied textures and
consistencies.72
3.2.5 Safe preparation, storage and use:
Complementary foods should be hygienically
prepared, stored and fed with clean hands, dishes
and utensils. Caregivers should wash their hands
with soap and practice good hygiene (including safe
disposal of child’s faeces) and proper food handling
(including separating raw and cooked food).73 Food will
spoil quickly after contact with germs; thus children
should be fed from a separate serving dish, with any
leftovers discarded. Exposure to unsafe food and
water increases the risk of microbial contamination
and leads to diarrhoea and nutrient loss. To avoid food
spoilage and contamination from insects, animals
and bacteria:
• Food should be covered;
• Cooked food should not be left at room
temperature for more than two hours;
• Food should be stored at low temperature (below
5°C) and preferably refrigerated;74
• Raw and cooked food should be stored separately;

3.2.7 Feeding during and after illness: Caregivers
should increase children’s fluid intake during illness
(including by frequent breastfeeding) and encourage
the child to eat (for example, by offering soft,
appetizing or favourite foods). After illness, caregivers
should provide meals more frequently than usual
and encourage the child to eat more.18, 78 Children in
special circumstances (e.g., those with congenital
abnormalities, allergies and disabilities) who have
specific dietary requirements and needs, will require
tailored support (see Spotlight 2).
Children should have continued access to a nutritious
and safe diet, at an affordable price, and obtained
and prepared in a sustainable manner. Poor
families spend a large proportion of their budget
on food and may purchase low cost foods to afford
other household purchases. 79 In many settings,
unhealthy and nutrient-poor foods and snacks are
less expensive than healthy foods. Sustainable diets
are those that are accessible, culturally acceptable,
affordable, nutritionally, adequate and safe. They are
produced from food systems that protect biodiversity
and ecosystems, while minimizing environmental
degradation from food production.79 *

• Raw fruits and vegetables should be washed with
clean water and stored in a cool place.
3.2.6 Responsive feeding and caregiving: Feeding
require a reciprocal relationship between children and
their caregivers. There are four stages of responsive
feeding: (1) the child signals hunger or satiety through
actions and expressions; (2) the caregiver recognizes
the cues; (3) the caregiver’s response is prompt,
nurturing, and developmentally appropriate; and,
(4) the child experiences the caregiver’s response.
Responsive feeding helps children develop selfregulation over food intake and facilitates their
transition to eating independently.75 Social interactions
between caregiver and child (such as speaking to the
child, singing, and encouraging him/her) also stimulate
connections in the child’s brain and promote cognitive
development. Several studies have shown a positive
association between responsive feeding and improved
child nutrition.76 Responsive feeding practices, where
caregivers interact with the child and respond to his
or her hunger and satiety cues, have been found to
improve children’s acceptance of food and adequate
food intake.76, 77

* This Programming Guidance highlights the importance of sustainable diets; however, it is beyond its scope to address this issue
comprehensively. This area of work will be explored further in future
editions as UNICEF continues to develop its approach to delivering
sustainable diets through food systems.

Determinants
and drivers of
young children’s
diets during the
complementary
feeding period

18   UNICEF Programming Guidance

The determinants of young children’s diets during
the complementary feeding period include adequate
complementary foods, adequate complementary
feeding practices, and adequate nutrition services
(Figure 3). These determinants are shaped by contextspecific factors – referred to as drivers.
Together, the determinants and drivers of young
children’s diets determine children’s ability to enjoy
nutritious, safe, affordable and sustainable diets that
protect, promote and support survival, growth and
development.
4.1 ADEQUATE FOODS

The adequacy of foods to improve young children’s
diets is driven by the availability, access, affordability
and desirability of such foods.
4.1.1 Availability: Poor production, storage
and distribution of nutritious food reduces its
availability within households and markets and

ADEQUATE
FOODS

children

Figure 3: Determinants of young children’s diets

increases its price.84 Vulnerabilities and shocks to
the food system due to climate change, seasonal
fluctuations, diseases, conflicts, political instability,
unemployment and rising food prices can also impact
food availability and livestock and crop production.85
The limited availability of nutritious food is a barrier to
consumption, even when caregivers can afford such
foods.
4.1.2 Access: Long distances to markets, poor
roads and infrastructure, and humanitarian crises
can make it difficult for families to access nutritious
foods. Seasonality of production also impacts the
availability of nutritious and diverse foods.86-88 Conflict
may impede access to production activities, such
as planting, harvesting and livestock movement.
Children’s access to nutritious foods is also influenced
by food industry marketing and the presence
or absence of a protective policy environment
(Spotlight 4).
4.1.3 Affordability: Nutrient-rich foods – particularly
animal-source foods – can be too costly for many
families, leading to poor dietary diversity in children. 40,
89, 90
Fortified complementary foods are also expensive
relative to unfortified cereals.40 Household purchasing
power is often determined by income, intra-household
allocation of financial resources and the support
provided by safety net programmes. Humanitarian
crises can also significantly raise food prices by
limiting food production and the supply of diverse
foods.
4.1.4 Desirability: The increasing availability of lowcost processed and ultra-processed foods, snacks,
and sugar-sweetened beverages increases their
desirability and consumption in children.91-93 Foods
of lower nutritional value often cost less per calorie
and tend to be selected by households with lower
socioeconomic status.94, 95 Street foods and processed
foods are convenient, low in nutrient quality, and
readily available for those with limited time.96, 97

Improving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period   19

4. 2 ADEQUATE SERVICES

Health, nutrition, water and sanitation, and social
protection services play a critical role in influencing
the quality of children’s diets. The adequacy of these
services is driven by their availability, affordability, use
and quality.
4.2.1 Availability, affordability and use of
health and nutrition services: Limited availability
of preventive and curative services within the
health system, such as nutrition counselling,
micronutrient supplementation and the care of
sick children, can undermine complementary
feeding practices and limit the use of such
services by families.98, 99 Access to health and
nutrition services may be further reduced during
humanitarian crises. Where health and nutrition
services are available, high costs can deter their
access and use.100 User fees can make child health
and nutrition services unaffordable to vulnerable
households, thereby limiting contact with the
health system and opportunities for counselling on
complementary feeding.
4.2.2 Quality of health and nutrition services: It
is not enough for services to be available; they must
also be delivered with quality. High-quality nutrition
counselling services to improve the diets of young
children require consistent delivery of messages
and support through multiple contact opportunities
with caregivers.101, 102 Low-quality health and
nutrition services are ineffective in changing feeding
behaviours and can reduce the demand for and
use of these services by families.102 The limited
knowledge, inadequate skills and misconceptions
of health workers and inconsistent messaging
can contribute to poor quality counselling.6, 99 The
capacity of health workers to deliver quality services
is driven by multiple factors, including training
methodology, supportive supervision, the availability
of tools and job aids, access to adequate human
resources, remuneration, regularity of payment
and workload.103
4.2.3 Availability, quality and use of social
protection services: Social protection programmes
can improve household purchasing power and
food security, increasing the likelihood that
nutritious foods will be made available for young
children.104, 105 Such programmes for vulnerable

20   UNICEF Programming Guidance

households are particularly important in times
of stress or shocks.106, 107 The provision of food
vouchers for households with children, for example,
can provide vital support for improving children’s
diets during emergencies.108 Social protection
programmes may also be used to incentivize the
use of health and nutrition services. The quality of
such programmes is key: well-planned, designed
and implemented social protection programmes
are most effective at targeting vulnerable and food
insecure households and influencing behaviours.
4.2.4 Availability, quality, affordability and use
of water and sanitation services: Access to basic
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in the
household, community and health facility improves
hygiene and sanitation behaviours and ensures the
safety of complementary foods. The availability of
toilet facilities, refuse collection, safe water and other
sanitation services reduces the risk of contaminating
feeding utensils and complementary foods. In
contrast, long distances to a safe water source and
high costs of water and sanitation services can limit
access and force caregivers to use inferior services.
4.3 ADEQUATE PR ACTICES

The feeding, care and hygiene practices of caregivers
are key determinants of the quality of young children’s
diets. These practices are driven by caregivers’
knowledge and time, household dynamics and social
norms.
4.3.1 Caregiver knowledge: Caregivers’ knowledge
and behaviours on how to produce, store, process and
use nutritious foods are an important determinant of
children’s diets.109 Lack of knowledge and experience
reduces caregivers’ ability to make appropriate food
purchasing decisions and limits their acceptance and
use of diverse foods.110
4.3.2 Caregiver time: Work and household
responsibilities constrain caregivers’ time and
affect their ability to prepare and feed nutritious
foods at the recommended frequency. Women are
the primary caregivers of young children in most
contexts, and in many settings, their time is taken by
household chores, such as fetching firewood or water,
agricultural labour, and other non-farm employment,
leaving limited time and energy for childcare. In
urban areas, working parents face important time

constraints in preparing nutritious meals and
frequently feeding their children. The choice
of complementary foods is therefore often
shaped by convenience and the desire to
balance time for food preparation with other
household demands.
4.3.3 Household dynamics: Children’s diets
are shaped by the distribution of food within
the household, the prioritization of nutritious
diets for children, women’s decision-making
in food purchasing, and gender preferences
in feeding children. The caregiver’s ability
to provide appropriate feeding and care to
their young child is also impacted by factors
such as stress, emotional well-being and
mental health).111 These intra-household
dynamics can be improved with support from
social protection programmes, interventions
to support caring of caregiver, as well
as through gender-sensitive health and
nutrition programmes that foster women’s
empowerment and men’s participation in
feeding, care and child-rearing.112
4.3.4 Social norms: Social and cultural norms
influence what, when and how children are
fed.106, 113, 114 The knowledge, beliefs and
behaviours of family members (particularly
mothers, fathers, grandmothers and older
women) strongly influence complementary
feeding practices 115, 116 and the demand for
health services.

Evidence on
what works
for improving
young children’s
diets

22   UNICEF Programming Guidance

This section presents key interventions for improving
young children’s diets and describes their supporting
evidence base. Annex 1 synthesizes further evidence
on the effectiveness of these interventions for
improving child growth outcomes.
5.1 NUTRITION COUNSELLING AND
SOCIAL AND BEHAVIOUR CHANGE
COMMUNICATION

Nutrition counselling and social and behaviour
change communication (SBCC) involve the strategic
use of communication approaches across a variety
of channels to promote changes in knowledge,
attitudes, norms, beliefs and behaviours.117 To date,
nutrition counselling and SBCC have been the
primary approaches used to improve complementary
feeding practices.
Nutrition counselling and SBCC, provided alone or in
combination with other interventions, are effective
in improving complementary feeding practices,
caregiver knowledge on feeding practices and
nutrition outcomes.118, 119 They are also effective in
improving dietary diversity, the consumption of ironrich foods, the consumption of a minimum acceptable
diet and child growth outcomes (such as HAZ and
WAZ).99, 101, 120-124 While nutrition counselling and SBCC
can improve complementary feeding outcomes, their
effectiveness depends on access to diverse and
nutritious foods at the household level.101
To make an impact, nutrition counselling and SBCC
must be intensive, sustained, action-oriented and
integrated in routine health service delivery.99, 122
This includes clear messages, delivered with
consistency and desired intensity through multiple
communication channels. Spotlight 3 provides an
overview of evidence-based best practices supporting
nutrition counselling and SBCC to improve young
children’s diets.

5. 2 COUNSELLING AND EDUCATION ON
RESPONSIVE FEEDING AND STIMUL ATION

Responsive feeding happens when caregivers
encourage children to eat, provide food in response to
their appetite and satiety signals and feed them with
care. Counselling on responsive feeding can promote
self-feeding, improve nutrient intake, and reduce the
risk of undernutrition and overweight.77, 125, 126 Growth
and brain development depend on good nutrition,
stimulation and caregiver emotional responsiveness.
Therefore, supporting caregivers to use mealtime
as an opportunity for social interaction can improve
child growth and development.76, 127 Further evidence
is needed to understand how response feeding
interventions can be integrated and scaled-up as part
of complementary feeding programmes across diverse
contexts, and how non-responsive feeding may
contribute to child overweight.75, 128, 129
5.3 ACCESS TO DIVERSE AND NUTRITIOUS
COMPLEMENTARY FOODS AT HOUSEHOLD
LEVEL

Interventions to improve access to nutritious foods at
household level are key to supporting optimal growth
and development in young children. In a study of one
high stunting context, providing one egg a day to
young children for a period of six months improved
their growth (LAZ and WAZ) and decreased stunting.130
A longitudinal follow-up after two years showed
continued reduction in growth faltering; however,
the effects on linear growth were not sustained.131
In other contexts, meat supplements132 and dietary
modification (through the production and consumption
of animal-source foods and orange-red fruits such as
papayas and mangoes) improved dietary diversity. Such
interventions also improved linear growth and reduced
anaemia and other micronutrient deficiencies.124 Further
evidence is needed from a range of programme
settings to understand how these interventions can be
scaled-up to improve children’s diets.

providers, frontline workers,
and other key influencers
at household, community

 Begin counselling and

months of age to address the
timely introduction of food
and continue age-appropriate
messages until 24 months of age,
including with family members
who are involved in feeding or

environment.

 Conduct nutrition
counselling in individual or

as food-based approaches
or systems strengthening
interventions.

 Sustain comprehensive
nutrition counselling and
SBCC approaches for at least
two years, with continuous
monitoring and adjustments,122
and document learnings.

Enhancing agricultural production of nutritious foods
is another way to improve access to diverse children’s
diets. Support through agricultural inputs and extension
services, small livestock production and homestead
food production has shown to improve the availability
of nutritious and safe complementary foods.84, 133,
134
Agricultural production alone may be insufficient
to improve child nutrition outcomes; however, when
combined with nutrition counselling, SBCC, home visits
and food demonstrations, agricultural interventions
can improve caregiver knowledge, enhance feeding
practices, and increase the likelihood of children
receiving the minimum acceptable diet.84, 135, 136 These
interventions have also been shown to improve young
children’s growth, haemoglobin levels, and nutrient
intake.133, 135-137
5.4 USE OF VITAMIN AND MINER AL
SUPPLEMENTS IN SET TINGS WHERE
NUTRIENT- POOR DIETS PREVAIL

When integrated into programmes to improve
complementary feeding, vitamin and mineral
supplements such as MNPs, can be added to home
prepared foods to enhance the quality of children’s
diets by providing adequate nutrients to prevent
micronutrient deficiencies.* WHO recommends home
fortification with iron containing MNPs for young
children in settings where nutrient-rich foods are
inaccessible or unaffordable, or where the prevalence
of anaemia in children is greater than 20 percent.138
The integration of MNPs into IYCF programmes
should always be coupled with counselling on its use
and nutrition education to improve complementary
feeding practices.
There is a strong evidence to support the effectiveness
of MNPs in preventing anaemia and iron deficiency
in children aged 6–23 months.139-143 MNP integration
into IYCF programmes has been shown to incentivize
participation,144 increase caregiver knowledge on
appropriate complementary feeding,142, 145 improve the
consistency of complementary foods,146, 147 facilitate
timely initiation of solid foods at 6 months of age,
improve dietary diversity, and improve population-based
feeding indicators.142, 148 It may also increase linear
growth in children.149 Implementation strategies for
MNPs should be not be implemented in isolation and
* Some countries may integrate the use of other mineral and vitamin
supplements such as multiple micronutrient syrups or chewable
tablets for young children in their programmes; however, this is not
covered in the Programming Guidance.

integrated into all areas of IYCF programming, including
policy development, formative research, delivery
mechanisms, SBCC, and monitoring and evaluation
to ensure they reinforce appropriate complementary
feeding practices.150
5.5 ACCESS TO FORTIFIED FOODS AS
NEEDED, ALIGNED WITH GLOBAL AND
NATIONAL STANDARDS

Fortified foods can improve complementary feeding
and children’s nutritional status in settings where
nutrient-poor diets are common and access to
diverse foods is limited.7 Promoting access to fortified
complementary foods with or without nutrition
counselling can improve children’s linear growth in
food-insecure settings,123 though more evidence is
needed from food-secure settings. Fortified blended
foods containing locally available cereals and pulses
(such as a corn-soya blend), have shown to be
particularly effective in humanitarian response.151, 152 The
provision of specialized fortified products, such as small
quantity-lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS), in
combination with nutrition counselling and SBCC, may
also improve feeding practices, though their impact on
improving dietary diversity is limited.153 Recent evidence
from low- and middle-income countries154 suggests that
SQ-LNS, in combination with complementary feeding,
have the potential to improving growth outcomes
(stunting, wasting and underweight) and anaemia
among young children. These products are costly,
however, and their integration into routine programming
may be cost prohibitive.
Interventions to improve access to fortified
complementary foods should be implemented in line
with international and national regulations, including
the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk
Substitutes and relevant WHA resolutions, and the
2016 Guidance on Ending Inappropriate Promotion of
Foods for Infants and Children (Spotlight 4).
5.6 ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND
NUTRITIOUS FOODS THROUGH SOCIAL
PROTECTION PROGR AMMES AND
COUNSELLING SERVICES

Social protection programmes can improve access
to affordable and nutritious complementary foods
and nutrition counselling services among vulnerable
households. Nutrition-sensitive social protection

Improving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period   25

services, such as cash transfers, integrated
microcredit, and nutrition education can improve
household food security, dietary diversity and caregiver
empowerment.105, 155 They also address some of the
basic causes of child malnutrition by narrowing the gaps
in economic access and promoting women’s decisionmaking. Certain types of social protection programmes,
such as cash transfers, can increase the household
budget for food purchase, which in turn influences what
children eat.156 In humanitarian situations, cash transfers
can prevent negative coping responses to food scarcity
(such as reducing the number of meals per day),
improve dietary intake and access to diverse foods for
children.157
The integration of nutrition counselling and SBCC
within social protection programmes is critical to
ensure that the resources provided to the household
are used to improve the diets of young children.
Common approaches include combining cash
transfers with nutrition counselling,158, 159 and providing
fortified foods, curative and preventive health services
(such as immunizations), growth promotion,160 wellchild visits,161 and MNPs.158
5.7 ACCESS TO SAFE WATER AND CLE AN
HOUSEHOLD ENVIRONMENTS FOR YOUNG
CHILDREN

Nutrition counselling and SBCC on the recommended
feeding practices, together with access to basic
WASH services at household level, can improve
caregiver knowledge of the recommended hygiene
and sanitation behaviours and decrease faecal
contamination of complementary foods.162-165
Evidence shows that community-level sanitation
access has a greater impact on nutrition outcomes
than household level access.166 As such, communitywide WASH-nutrition approaches may be critical to
significantly reduce environmental contamination to
improve children’s diets. It is vital to understand which
of the fecal-oral routes are most relevant in a given
context and ensure they are adequately targeted in
programme design. Additional evidence is needed
from implementation research and programme
settings to understand the most effective design and
scale-up of such integrated programmes.

26   UNICEF Programming Guidance

Spotlight 4

Addressing the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and
young children
In 2016, WHO developed Guidance on ending the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young
children . 44, 167 The Guidance covers all commercially produced foods and beverages that are marketed as
suitable for feeding children aged 6–36 months. Products are considered to have been “marketed as suitable”
for this age group if they:
•

are labelled with the words
baby/babe/infant/toddler/
young child;

•

recommend an age of
consumption of less than
3 years;

•

use an image of a child that
appears to be 3 years of age
or younger or is feeding with a
bottle; or

•

are in any other way
represented as suitable for
children under the age of 3
years.

The Guidance defines ‘promotion’
as the communication of
messages that are designed
to persuade or encourage the
purchase or consumption of a
product or raise awareness of a
brand. This includes advertising
activities and materials, nonadvertising promotions (such as
special displays, sales, discount
coupons and rebates, lossleaders and tie-in sales), and
labelling, packaging and claims.

The Guidance provides seven
recommendations:
1. Optimal infant and young child
feeding should be promoted
based on the guiding principles
for complementary feeding and
feeding non-breastfed children
aged 6–24 months, with an
emphasis on nutrient-rich, homeprepared and locally available
foods.
2. Products that function as
breastmilk substitutes should not
be promoted.
3. Foods for infants and young
children that do not function as
breastmilk substitutes should
be promoted only if they
meet all the relevant national,
regional and global standards
for composition, safety, quality
and nutrient levels, and are
in line with national dietary
guidelines.
4. The messages used to promote
foods for infants and young
children should support optimal
feeding and should not include
inappropriate messages.

5. There should be no crosspromotion of breastmilk
substitutes indirectly via the
promotion of foods for infants
and young children.
6. Companies that market foods
for infants and young children
should not create conflicts of
interest in health facilities or
throughout health systems.
Health workers, health systems,
health professional associations
and non-governmental
organizations should avoid such
conflicts of interest.
7. The WHO set of
recommendations on the
marketing of foods and nonalcoholic beverages to children168
should be fully implemented,
with particular attention to
ensuring that settings where
infants and young children
gather are free from all forms of
marketing of foods high in fats,
sugars or salt.

Action
framework to
improve the
diets of young
children
during the
complementary
feeding period

28   UNICEF Programming Guidance

Improving young children’s diets requires countries
to deliver programmes grounded in evidence-based
interventions (described in section 5) at scale,
with quality and equity. To achieve the desired
impact, such interventions must be designed and
implemented to respond to the context-specific
drivers of children’s diets. These interventions will be
implemented through one or more systems – food,
health, water and sanitation, and social protection
(explored further in section 6.2).
The Action Framework to Improve the Diets of Young
Children During the Complementary Feeding Period
(hereafter referred to as the Action Framework) is
a tool for facilitating programming to improve the
diets of children aged 6–23 months. Applying the
Action Framework facilitates a systematic analysis
of the context-specific drivers of poor diets during
the complementary feeding period and prioritizes
strategic actions for addressing them through
relevant systems (Figure 4). The Action Framework
enables UNICEF staff serving in regional and country
offices to support governments and partners in
the design, implementation and monitoring of
evidence-based programmes to improve the diets of
young children.
6.1 ELEMENTS OF THE ACTION
FR AMEWORK

The Action Framework has seven elements that
interplay to facilitate the design and implementation
of evidence-based programmes. This section
describes these elements and how they contribute
to the outcome of nutritious, safe, affordable and
sustainable diets (i.e. good diets) for young children.

6.1.1 Situation analysis to understand the status
and drivers of young children’s diets
Situation analysis is the first step to designing an
evidence-based programme. A sound situation
analysis helps the country team identify the contextspecific drivers of children’s diets and prioritize
strategic actions. Situation analysis for complementary
feeding programmes entails a systematic examination
of the status, trends and drivers of poor diets for
young children. It should be informed by a review
of quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from
Demographic Health Surveys, National Nutrition
Surveys, other national and local surveys and
studies), the policy environment, existing programme
service delivery, and interviews with stakeholders
in government, UN agencies and non-governmental
organizations.

Barriers to nutritious diets should be assessed through
a market analysis of locally available foods, including
their availability and promotion, and public perceptions
of commercially produced complementary foods (see
Annex 3 and 4). A mapping of country stakeholders
and partnerships is a vital component of the situation
analysis, which should be undertaken through a
consensus building process with the government
and partners. Engaging national stakeholders in this
process promotes national ownership and programme
sustainability.
Evidence on food consumption patterns, cost of
diets and nutrient gap analyses for children aged
6–23 months should also be reviewed to understand
the magnitude of dietary limitations.169-171 Annex 2
describes some of the tools available to aid such
analyses. In emergency contexts, it is also important
to understand pre-existing nutrient gaps versus those
that have been exacerbated by the situation. There
is also a need to understand the risks inherent in
emergency contexts and identify the actions needed
to strengthen systems or enhance preparedness to
ensure that programmes can scale up or down in
response (see Spotlight 7).

(including women’s empowerment, intra-household
dynamics and gender roles).

6.1.2 Determinants and drivers of young
children’s diets
As outlined in section in 4, adequate foods, adequate
services and adequate practices are the underlying
determinants of good diets for young children. These
determinants are driven by contextual factors (i.e.
drivers), that enable or inhibit a child’s access to and
regular consumption of nutritious, safe, affordable and
sustainable diets.

Situation analysis in a country may highlight the lack
of access to diverse foods at household level as a
key determinant of inadequate child diets. A more
in-depth analysis may reveal that national policies are
not addressing children’s needs, gaps in institutional
capacity are restricting service delivery, the lack of
food-based dietary guidelines is limiting the production
of diverse foods, and women’s role in agriculture is
restricting their time for child feeding and care.

An in-depth analysis of the gaps, bottlenecks and
barriers to adequate foods, services and practices is
critical to explore why young children’s diets are not
improving in a particular context. This process should
ideally be built into the country situation analysis and
should consider: (1) the policy environment (policies,
legislation, multisectoral collaboration, accountability);
(2) the institutional capacity to plan, finance and
implement; and (3) behaviours at household level

Systems-strengthening is a guiding
principle of UNICEF programming in
all contexts. It involves developing the
government’s institutional capacity to
deliver and monitor actions to improve
children’s diets, including through
support to expand human resource
capacity, improve service delivery,

develop standards and guidelines,
establish information and accountability
systems, and improve governance and
financing. When systems-strengthening
efforts continue during emergencies they
can promote community resilience and
help institutionalize actions to improve
children’s diets over the long-term.

6.1.3 Implementing strategic actions through
systems
Implementing strategic actions to achieve the
outcome of good diets for young children will require
UNICEF to influence and leverage the potential of
four systems: food, health, water and sanitation, and
social protection. Section 6.2 explores these systemspecific actions in further detail.

Strategic actions address the context-specific gaps,
bottlenecks and barriers to good diets for young
children. In prioritizing strategic actions, UNICEF
country offices should consider the evidencebased interventions for improving young children’s
diets, the programming context (described below),
UNICEF’s comparative advantage, human and
financial resources, access to resources in the
country, and the activities planned by partners
and stakeholders.
The actions prioritized at country level should be
specific, costed, and include accountabilities for
different stakeholders, including government and
partners. This should occur through a consultative
process, preferably via national nutrition coordination
platforms such as the Scaling Up Nutrition
movement and Nutrition Cluster platforms.
At policy level, actions may involve advocating for
policies, legislation, plans, budgets, coordination,
partnerships and accountability mechanisms
for improving young children’s diets. These are
essential building blocks for a strengthened enabling
environment that can catalyse change at country
level (see Spotlight 6).

32   UNICEF Programming Guidance

At institutional level, actions may involve systemsstrengthening to boost the government’s institutional
capacity to deliver and monitor evidence-based
actions to improve children’s diets (see Spotlight 5).
6.1.4 Programming context
The programming context is defined as the setting in
which the country programming is being implemented.
It takes into account contextual features such as food
insecurity, emergencies, urbanization, and political
and economic instability. Spotlight 7 illustrates how
food insecurity, humanitarian crises, and the double
burden of malnutrition can influence the prioritization
of strategic actions at country level.
6.1.5 Monitoring, evaluation and learning
Monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) is central
to the design and implementation of complementary
feeding programmes. Further details are provided in
Section 7.

Spotlight 6

The building blocks of an enabling environment for improving young
children’s diets
Supportive policy and legal frameworks
A policy landscape analysis is an important first
step in identifying gaps in the policies and legal
frameworks driving complementary feeding
outcomes and advocating with the government
to address them (Annex 3). Providing technical
support to government is also critical to
formulating comprehensive national policies
and legislation, and implementing, monitoring,
enforcing and evaluating them.

feeding practices and address them through
SBCC. Key components of social change
include sustainability through local ownership;
empowering communication; an emphasis
on dialogue, debate, and negotiation; and an
emphasis on communities and families as the
agents of their own change.

Strengthened institutional coordination
Improving young children’s diets requires
coordinated service delivery across sectors,
such as health, agriculture, social protection,
water and sanitation, and the private sector.
This entails strengthening multisectoral plans,
budgets and coordination, together with
stakeholder mapping and clearly defining the
roles and accountabilities of government and
non-state actors in accomplishing planned
outcomes.
Leveraging financial resources
Improving young children’s diets will require
leveraging financial resources to implement
priority actions at national and decentralized
levels across relevant sectors. This entails
advocacy and technical support to the
government in developing costed actions plans
and advocacy with partners to invest in relevant
actions at national and sub-national level.
Strengthened results-based programme
design and implementation
Providing technical support to a range of
government departments can help strengthen
national plans, strategies, budgets and
monitoring systems for improving young
children’s diets. This includes fostering
coherence and linkages across sector plans,
strategies and budgets directed towards a
common nutrition outcome.
Understanding and shifting social and cultural
norms around young child feeding
Improving young children’s diets also
involves examining and attempting to shift
harmful social and cultural norms, including
those related to gender roles and the stigma
attached to disability. A situation analysis
can help identify the critical social norms,
beliefs and taboos hindering adequate child

Prioritizing strategic actions according to programme context
A. Food insecurity
Food security – measured
through food availability,
accessibility, use and the
stability of these dimensions
over time – is an underlying
determinant of poor diets in
young children. 85 Food insecurity
can be chronic or transitory,
and may persist through
droughts, famines, localized food
shortages, high food prices and
seasonal variations.172
Programmes designed in the
context of food insecurity should
focus on removing barriers to
the availability, access, and
use of affordable, nutritious
foods, taking into consideration
seasonal fluctuations and
the capacity of systems to
deliver. Actions may include
improving options for storage,
processing and packaging of
nutrient-rich foods, stimulating
food production during lean
months (e.g., through homebased gardening), providing
fortified foods or vitamin and
mineral supplements, and
strengthening linkages with
social protection programmes
and nutrition counselling.
B. Humanitarian crises
Humanitarian situations are
characterized by limited access
to safe food and clean water
and a breakdown in basic health
services.173 Security challenges,

stress, lack of access to cooking
fuel, and poor access to a
clean environment may affect
caregivers’ ability to provide safe
and nutritious complementary
foods to children. Improving
children’s diets during
emergencies requires a response
grounded in sound situation
analysis, systems with the
capacity to deliver, and available
resources. The approach should
involve building institutional
capacity and supporting the
government to mitigate the
effect of humanitarian crisis and
facilitate sustainable recovery.
In sudden onset emergencies,
immediate responses may
include provision of food
assistance, safe drinking
water, and cooking equipment.
In cases of migration, the
provision of nutrient-rich
complementary foods through
onsite supplementary feeding
programmes and the distribution
of food rations for households
with young children may be
prioritized. In economic and slow
onset emergencies, ensuring
sustained access to nutritious
and healthy complementary
foods may require reliance
on cash transfers (or similar
programmes), which can be used
to increase household resources
for food and improve access to
nutrition services.

C. The double burden of
malnutrition
The double burden of
malnutrition* has led to a shift
towards diets characterized by
refined and processed foods that
are high in sugar, fat and salt, and
low in nutrient density.174 This in
turn has led to increased caloric
consumption, especially in urban
areas in low- and middle-income
countries, resulting in rising rates
of childhood overweight, obesity
and micronutrient deficiencies.
Situation analysis should
assess both undernutrition and
overweight-related drivers and
their distribution by geographic
location, socio-economic status,
and sex. Policies to address the
double burden may focus on
regulating the nutrient content
of commercial complementary
foods to align with food-based
dietary guidelines. Further, the
promotion of diversified diets
can prevent both overweight
and undernutrition in children.
Countries should also consider
policies to improve the external
food environment (such as
sugar-sweetened beverage
taxes), which can decrease
the risk of overweight. Finally,
understanding the drivers of
caregiver decisions to purchase
unhealthy food is critical.

* The double burden refers to the simultaneous existence of multiple forms of undernutrition and overweight within individuals, households and
populations at various points across the life course.

6. 2 DELIVERING STR ATEGIC ACTIONS
THROUGH SYSTEMS

For UNICEF, a systems approach aims to leverage
the potential of food, health, water and sanitation,
and social protection systems* and make them more
accountable for delivering nutrition results for young
children. Rather than simple coordination among
systems, a systems approach requires a shared vision,
joint planning and monitoring. Leveraging the power of
multiple systems expands the number of opportunities
to reach children and improve their diets in a more
comprehensive and systematic way. Indeed, each
system has a role to play in achieving the outcome of
good diets for young children (Figure 4).
The Action Framework can be applied to each of
the four systems to identify strategic actions to
address the drivers of children’s diets. Depending on
the country-specific drivers, strategic actions, and
programming context, the country should identify
which system(s) need to be leveraged to accomplish
the outcome of good diets for young children.

For example, improving dietary diversity requires
a food system that can produce diverse local
foods that are accessible to households; a health
system with staff at facility and community level
to provide education and counselling on optimal
complementary feeding practices; a water and
sanitation system that allows for hygienic food
preparation and provides safe drinking water as an
essential component of a healthy diet; and, a social
protection system that helps poor families afford a
variety of nutritious foods, have access to essential
health and nutrition services, and adopt positive
feeding, care and hygiene practices.
The section below presents an Action Framework
for each system. While each framework can be
applied in isolation, the actions illustrated will
often be delivered in conjunction with actions
through other systems to address the drivers of
young children’s diets.

* The education system does not directly influence the diets of children aged 6–23 months given that these children do not yet attend school/
pre-school; it is therefore not discussed in this guidance. However, where applicable, some actions indirectly related to the education system have
been integrated throughout the document.

OUTCOME

6.2.1 Action Framework for Delivering through
the Food System*
The food system encompasses all elements and
activities related to the production, processing,
storage, distribution, marketing, preparation, and
consumption of food.175, 176 The food system is
comprised of the food supply chain; the food
environment; and the behaviours of caregivers around
the foods they purchase and feed their children.175

When food systems are designed with children in
mind, they can make food more available, affordable,
acceptable, and safe, making it easier for caregivers to
make nutritious food choices.177 When engaging with
partners to shape the food system, caution is required
to avoid conflicts of interest from companies that
market foods for infants and children, as described in
the WHO Guidance on the Inappropriate Promotion of
Foods for Infants and Young Children.178

• Limited caregiver time and high workload, making it
difficult to prepare nutritious meals;
• Caregiver or family members preferences for the
convenience and the desirability of unhealthy food.
Strategic actions for activating the food system to
improve young children’s diets

The Action Framework illustrates strategic actions
that UNICEF may undertake in collaboration with the
government and partners at the policy, institutional,
and community/household level to address the drivers
of children’s diets through the food system (Figure
6). The actions proposed in the Action Framework
are illustrative rather than exhaustive and should
be adapted and expanded according to the country
context.
At policy level, actions to influence the food
system may include advocacy, policy development
and fostering coordination across relevant sectors
to increase access to nutrient-rich foods for young
children; strengthening protective legislation on the
marketing of foods and beverages to children; and
promoting alignment with international norms and
standards (e.g., the Code and WHA resolution 69.9).

This section reviews examples of food-system
related drivers that need to be addressed to
improve young children’s diets and complements
the discussion in section 4.
Food supply chain:
• Lack of nutrition-sensitive agricultural policies,
programmes and investment plans;

At institutional level, actions to influence the
food system may include supporting the development
of food-based dietary guidelines, strengthening
monitoring systems, gaining a better understanding of
markets, strengthening capacity across sectors, and
using innovative marketing strategies to create market
demand for healthy food choices.

• Limited technology and incentives to produce
nutrient-rich crops;
• Limitations in appropriate post-harvest
management technologies (e.g., lack of access
to transportation, refrigeration, storage and other
processing methods, and seasonality factors).
Food environment:
• Limited availability and affordability of nutritious
foods in local markets;

• Poor regulation of commercially prepared
complementary foods and inappropriate marketing
of foods with limited nutritional value;
• High cost of nutritious and diverse complementary
foods.

At community/household/individual
level, actions to influence the food system may
include leveraging community platforms to raise
consumer demand for nutritious foods, engaging
with key influencers, fostering partnerships to scaleup community-based approaches, and supporting
nutrition-sensitive agriculture and livelihoods.

Behaviours of caregivers:
• Cultural preferences that limit the acceptability of
recommended feeding practices;
* The Action Framework for delivering through the food system
expands on the Innocenti Conceptual Framework of food system and
illustrates strategic actions for improving the diets of young children.

OUTCOME

6.2.2 Action Framework for Delivering through
the Health System
A strong health system includes preventive and
curative services, supports optimal health, nutrition
and hygiene practices, and contributes to equitable
health outcomes for all children. The health system
has traditionally led efforts to improve complementary
feeding and is a key platform for delivering health and
nutrition services such as skilled counselling, nutrition
education, outreach and SBCC.5 It also provides
important contact points, such as well-child and sick
child visits, growth monitoring and promotion, and
immunization visits, which can be used to promote
optimal complementary feeding behaviours. Engaging
with the health system therefore offers important
opportunities to improve the availability, quality,
affordability and use of health and nutrition services at
the facility and community level.

This section reviews examples of health system
related drivers that need to be addressed to
improve young children’s diets and complements
the discussion in section 4.
Health and nutrition services:
• Poor capacity of health providers and those
providing community extension services, as well as
health worker shortages, which limit the adoption
of appropriate practices;

• Limited access to affordable nutrition and health
care services, including long distances to reach
health centers.
Behaviours of caregivers:
• Inadequate caregiver knowledge and harmful
attitudes and beliefs, which may also be
influenced by others, such as mothers-in-law and
community leaders;

• The inappropriate health-seeking behaviours of
caregivers, their households and communities,
which limit their ability to access health
and nutrition services;
• Household dynamics, such as lack of time and
poor food distribution.

Strategic actions to activate the health system to
improve young children’s diets

The Action Framework illustrates strategic actions
that UNICEF may undertake in collaboration with
government and partners at the policy, institutional,
and community/household level to address the
drivers of children’s diets through the health system
(Figure 7). The actions proposed in the Action
Framework are illustrative rather than exhaustive and
should be adapted and expanded according to the
country context.
At policy level, actions to influence the
health system may include strengthening health
and nutrition-related policies, strategies, plans
and budgets; strengthening delivery platforms
and communication channels in national SBCC
strategies and plans using tested, context-specific
SBCC messages; integrating child nutrition
into plans for universal health care and noncommunicable diseases; and strengthening national
accountability mechanisms.
At institutional level, actions to influence
the health system may include strengthening the
capacity of the health system to deliver quality
services; enhancing capacities for evidence-based
analysis, prioritization, planning, budgeting, and
multisectoral coordination; advocating for innovative
pre-service and in-service training, mentoring and
supportive supervision of health workers; and
strengthening monitoring mechanisms to improve
service quality.
At community/household/individual
level, actions to influence the health system may
include strengthening the delivery of communitybased nutrition services; building the capacities
of community platforms to generate demand and
improve access to quality health and nutrition
services; strengthening linkages with social
protection programmes to reduce financial barriers;
and generating evidence for community-based
approaches to improving children’s diets.

SITUATION ANALYSIS

6.2.3 Action Framework for Delivering through
the Water and Sanitation System
The water and sanitation system is comprised of
the policies, programmes, services, and actors
that ensure a population’s access to and use of
safe drinking water and sanitation. This system is
critical to protecting young children’s diets, as poor
water, sanitation and hygiene can expose children to
pathogens that cause diarrhoea and other infections
and can result in environmental enteropathy, leading
to impaired structure and function of the small
intestine.179 Improved access to basic water and
sanitation services can reduce the risk of diarrhoea,180
helminth infections,181 environmental enteric
dysfunction (enteropathy)182, and anaemia.

Community-based platforms and contact points
provide important opportunities to promote
recommended WASH behaviours at community,
household and facility level. Strong water and
sanitation systems are therefore essential to
improving the availability, quality, affordability and
use of safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation
services for young children.
This section reviews examples of water and
sanitation system-related drivers that need to be
addressed to improve young children’s diets and
complements the discussion in section 4.
WASH supply and services:
• Limited availability of functional toilets, waste
treatment, and other WASH supplies and services;

• Poor access to WASH supplies, such as soap for
handwashing;
• Constraints in access to clean drinking water
sources, especially those within walking distance,
which influences the time caregivers spend on
household activities.

Strategic actions to activate the water and
sanitation system to improve young children’s diets

The Action Framework illustrates strategic actions
that UNICEF may undertake in collaboration with
government and partners at the policy, institutional,
and community/household level to address the drivers
of children diets through the water and sanitation
system (Figure 8). The actions proposed in the Action
Framework are illustrative rather than exhaustive and
should be adapted to country context.
At policy level, actions to influence the water
and sanitation system may include strengthening
integrated WASH, nutrition and health policies;
reviewing national SBCC strategies and plans across
sectors to ensure that recommended WASH and
nutrition behaviours are integrated; and tracking
nutrition and WASH indicators in the monitoring
systems of all relevant sectors.
At institutional level, actions to influence
the water and sanitation system may include
strengthening capacities for evidence-based analysis,
prioritization, planning and monitoring of integrated
WASH-nutrition actions during complementary
feeding period; developing counselling tools and
resources for frontline workers and caregivers; and
strengthening capacities for counselling and outreach
platforms.
At community/household/individual
level, actions to influence the water and sanitation
system may include advocating for consistent access
to essential WASH supplies; leveraging partnerships
to scale-up integrated nutrition-WASH SBCC
approaches; and generating evidence on communitybased approaches that link the recommended WASH
behaviours with actions for improving access to safe
and nutritious complementary foods.

Behaviours of caregivers:
• Limited caregiver and family members’ knowledge
and skills on safe handling of animal and human
faeces, food preparation, food storage, and
handwashing with soap;

• Limitations in the demand for WASH services,
the willingness and ability to pay for services,
and the use of latrines and other services at the
community and household level.

OUTCOME

6.2.4 Action Framework for Delivering through
the Social Protection System
The social protection system refers to a set of
policies and programmes aimed at protecting all
people against poverty, vulnerability and social
exclusion throughout the life course, with emphasis
on vulnerable groups.183 Nutrition-sensitive social
protection services, coupled with nutrition counselling
and education, can improve household food security,
dietary diversity and caregiver empowerment.105, 155

The social protection system can increase household
resources and reduce the price of food and nutrition
services through social transfers (e.g., food, cash,
vouchers), programmes to ensure economic and
social access to services, social support and care
services, and legislation and policies that prevent
discrimination in access to services and livelihoods.
Services to strengthen women’s empowerment and
decision-making in household spending can also
improve access to nutritious complementary foods.
The social protection system is therefore critical to
improving the availability, quality and affordability of
adequate food and services for young children.
This section reviews examples of social
protection-related drivers that need to be
addressed to improve young children’s diets and
complements the discussion in section 4.
Social protection programmes and services:
• Poor availability, coverage and effectiveness of
social protection programmes;

• Inadequate targeting of programmes that prevents
vulnerable households with young children from
receiving assistance.
Behaviours of caregivers:
• Lack of time and cultural norms and preferences
that negatively influence food purchasing,
preparation and allocation;

• Inadequate knowledge on social protection
programmes and their relation to feeding practices,
and limited decision-making power over money
and assets.

Strategic actions to activate the social protection
system to improve young children’s diets

The Action Framework illustrates strategic actions
that UNICEF may undertake in collaboration with
government and partners at the policy, institutional,
and community/household level to address the
drivers of children’s diets through the social
protection system (Figure 9). The actions proposed
in the Action Framework are illustrative rather than
exhaustive and should be adapted to country context.
At policy level, actions to influence the social
protection system may include strengthening the
design and targeting of programmes and services;
improving policies, strategies and budgets and
fostering coherence among sectors; and ensuring
that social protection programmes and delivery
platforms are supported by adequate national SBCC
strategies.
At institutional level, actions to influence the
social protection system may include strengthening
the capacity of delivery platforms to deliver
integrated social protection, health, agriculture and
nutrition interventions; prioritizing service delivery
platforms and contacts for delivering nutrition
counselling and SBCC aligned with other sectors;
integrating the use of available communication
resources (e.g., the ‘first foods’ videos); and
strengthening monitoring systems.
At community/household/individual
level, actions to influence the social protection
system may include strengthening the demand for
integrated social protection and nutrition services;
fostering women’s decision-making in food
purchasing and the feeding of nutritious and safe
complementary foods; and generating evidence
to inform the scale-up of integrated programmes
targeted at addressing gaps in knowledge around
food purchasing, feeding practices and use of
resources.

Monitoring,
evaluation and
learning

44   UNICEF Programming Guidance

The continuous generation, documentation,
sharing and application of knowledge is essential
to establishing a robust evidence base for best
practices on improving the diets of young children.
Monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) is thus
critical to effective programme implementation and
the achievement of programme objectives. MEL is
generally driven by questions such as: What is the
state of programme implementation (including pace,
progress against milestones)? Is the programme on
track to achieve targeted results? What corrective
actions, if any, are needed?

Recently, the definitions for indicators specific to
meal frequency, dietary diversity and continued
breastfeeding during the complementary feeding
period were slightly altered.32, 33 ** Additional
indicators were also developed to capture nondairy animal-source food consumption, fruit and
vegetable consumption, sugar-sweetened beverage
consumption, and unhealthy food consumption.
Table 1 provides definitions for new and revised
standard indicators relevant to the complementary
feeding period.

The scope of MEL activities for complementary
feeding programmes should reflect the wide range
of determinants and drivers known to impact
young children’s diets. MEL plans can then shed
light on the factors that may be limiting children’s
ability to consume nutritious, affordable and safe
complementary foods, across sectors.
7.1 ME ASURING PROGRESS ON
IMPROVING YOUNG CHILDREN’S DIETS

In order to facilitate appropriate assessment, targeting,
monitoring and evaluation of IYCF programmes, a set
of core IYCF indicators* related to the recommended
complementary feeding practices were defined and
published by WHO in 2008.184 These indicators were
subsequently adopted as the global standard and
integrated into national household surveys such as
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple
Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and national nutrition
and health surveys, to monitor progress on IYCF
practices at national, regional and global levels. These
indicators are used in programme-specific evaluations
to monitor outcomes or impact.70, 184

* These indicators are not the same as the recommendations. For
example, the indicator of minimum dietary diversity should not be
interpreted to mean that only five food groups out of eight (including
breastmilk) are needed for a healthy diet. Infants and young children
should ideally receive food from all food groups daily.

The tracking of these standard indicators is the pillar of
MEL at the outcome (or impact) level for programmes
to improve young children’s diets. To monitor
effectively, governments need to ensure that credible
and comprehensive data on complementary feeding
aligned with these standard global indicators are
reported every three to five years. UNICEF maintains
a global database16 of country-level estimates for all
standard IYCF indicators; however, these indicators
are not intended to meet all programme needs for
MEL, as they focus on feeding practices and do not
capture information related to access and availability
of safe and nutritious foods. Programmes should
complement these standard indicators with more
contextually-specific process indicators to reflect
planned activities and targets (discussed in more detail
later in this section).
7. 2 PROGR AMME MONITORING AND
EVALUATION

Implementing priority actions involves monitoring
progress and measuring changes in the diets of
young children at the sub-national and national level
using a set of indicators. Indicators should capture
impact, outcome and output level activities and
targets. To ensure that monitoring and evaluation
indicators and activities can effectively compare
** Part of the impetus for these revisions was the recognition that the
original indicators did not adequately capture the quality of children’s
diets.

Improving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period   45

programme progress against implementation plans,
their design should be closely aligned with their
programme’s theory of change.185 A theory of change
for a programme designed to improve the diets of
young children should acknowledge the key drivers
of complementary feeding and illustrate how actions
within each of their respective sectors contribute to
expected outputs or outcomes.
Programme specific monitoring and evaluation
indicators and activities – linked to priority actions
across drivers – should be included in the national
nutrition plan, or clearly defined within relevant
national or sub-national plans. Monitoring and
evaluation activities should be multi-year, with
activities planned throughout all stages of the
programme lifecycle.185 An illustrative results matrix

with generic indicators at all levels is presented in
Annex 6 and can serve as a useful tool which can be
contextualized as appropriate.
Both quantitative and qualitative methods may be
employed to collect identified monitoring indicators.*
Key sources of monitoring data at country-level
include health management information systems
(HMIS), logistics/supply management information
systems, and clinic records. These types of internal
data are ideal for programme monitoring given their
integration into existing government systems and
routine collection; however, it can be challenging to
* Programme monitoring is defined here as the ongoing process
of collecting, analysing, interpreting and reporting indicators to
determine how well a programme is being executed against planned
objectives. 202

46   UNICEF Programming Guidance

successfully advocate for the inclusion of new/updated
indicators and the quality of indicators is often poor.
Nonetheless, in many cases, government information
systems are the only source of data available for
monitoring. Strengthening routine monitoring
systems (national and decentralized) to adequately
track nutrition activities, and more specifically of
complementary feeding,* is therefore critical.186
Where modification or use of government system
indicators is not feasible, external monitoring can be
employed to collect selected indicators.
Programme evaluation may assess: (1) impact (what
happened?); (2) efficiency (what did it cost?); (3)
coverage (who was reached?); (4) process (how did
it happen); and, (5) causality (why did it happen?).
Evaluation design and objectives should be based on
the programme theory of change, local context and
available resources. Evaluations can be costly and
take time, and countries may not have the resources
or capacity to undertake a stand-alone evaluation. In
such cases, secondary data sources with primary data
collection can be used to fill the data gaps. While not
ideal, existing national surveys at country level are
often used to evaluate programme outcomes. In such
scenarios, UNICEF should advocate for the integration
of metrics on complementary feeding into national
surveys to inform decisions at country level and better
track programme implementation at global level.
Regardless of methods, the evaluation should provide
credible and useful findings to enable uptake of
evidence into programme and policy decision-making
processes.187

7.3 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND
LE ARNING

The data generated from monitoring and evaluation
activities should inform programme strategy and
decision-making, identify gaps where further research
is required, and be disseminated to facilitate learning
across countries and regions. The generation, use, and
reporting of evidence on the drivers of children’s diets
(detailed in section 4) is thus a critical part of MEL and
should be strengthened throughout the programme
lifecycle.
Learning and knowledge management plans
should be included in the design of complementary
feeding programmes. Plans should include evidence
generation, documentation, knowledge exchange
and dissemination, and priorities for research.
Documentation to chronicle programme experiences
and lessons learned is particularly critical – and too
often underprioritized. Knowledge exchange and
dissemination activities should be carefully planned to
ensure that documentation reaches the right audience,
in the right format, at the right time. The estimated
level of rigour and resources for each knowledge
management and learning activity should be planned
accordingly to secure the required support for
implementation.

* At the time of publishing this Programming Guidance, efforts
are under way in selected countries to pilot the integration of ageappropriate complementary feeding indicators in the HMIS.

Applying the
programming
guidance

48   UNICEF Programming Guidance

This UNICEF Programming Guidance aims to improve
the quality of complementary foods and feeding
practices by facilitating the scale-up of evidence-based
programmes using a systems approach. The guidance
responds to the call for evidence on implementing
multisectoral complementary feeding programmes
and articulates how country offices can better design,
implement, monitor and evaluate them.
The guidance introduces Action Frameworks as a tool
for facilitating action-oriented programming to improve
the diets of young children aged 6–23 months. It
recognizes that UNICEF country offices are at varied
levels of programming and applying these Action
Frameworks will involve prioritizing one or multiple
delivery systems, depending on the country context.
The food system, which has long been neglected,
should be prioritized in most cases, in addition to
other relevant systems. To illustrate, if the limited
availability of diverse and affordable complementary
foods is a driver of young children’s diets, countries
may prioritize strategic actions for influencing the
food system at policy, institutional and community
level, while linking actions through social protection
programmes (to influence food affordability) and
health systems (to establish the needed regulatory
environment on food safety and marketing and to
strengthen capacity in healthcare work force).
At country level, the Programming Guidance can
be applied to strengthen the policy environment
for improving young children’s diets by influencing
the national policies, strategies and costed action
plans across multiple systems. It can also be applied
to strengthen the capacities of relevant systems
to deliver quality services and address demandrelated barriers to accessing them at community and
household levels. UNICEF country offices should
use a consultative process involving the government
and other relevant stakeholders at every stage of
programming. The Programming Guidance should
also be used to strengthen MEL with the goal of
generating evidence, documenting results, and
improving accountability at multiple levels and across
multiple systems.

When adapted at the regional level, the Programming
Guidance can support the development of a regional
agenda and roadmap for improving young children’s
diets through quality support to countries. The
Action Frameworks should be adapted to regional
context* through a consultative process of engaging
partners, including UN agencies, regional economic
commissions, civil society networks, and existing
coordination platforms (such as SUN and regional
nutrition working groups).
Applying the Programming Guidance at country and
regional levels could include:
• Influencing governments and partners to prioritize
and invest in improving the diets of young children
through strengthening national nutrition action plans
and strategies;
• Strengthening coordination and partnerships
to address multiple barriers and bottlenecks to
improving young children’s diets;
• Forging partnerships with the Ministry of
Agriculture, Trade, Industry, and others to
strengthen food systems and make nutritious diets
available and affordable;
• Building synergies within the health system to
optimize opportunities for linking health, nutrition
and WASH services to improve the quality of young
children’s diets;
• Influencing national social protection programmes
to be more nutrition-sensitive and designed and
targeted to improve young children’s diets;
• Strengthening coherence and synergy in the
policies, budgets and services designed to improve
nutrition outcomes for young children.
These actions have the power to catalyse progress
at national, regional and global levels to prevent all
forms of malnutrition by promoting adequate foods,
adequate services and adequate practices and
therefore, ensure a brighter future for children and
their families.

* At the time of publishing this Programming Guidance, the Action Framework has already been adapted to regional context in four of the seven
UNICEF regions.

Annex 4: Assessing availability, promotion and perception of
commercially produced complementary foods, snacks and
beverages
It is well established that food product promotion can negatively influence the diets of infants and young children.46-48 The
Code and the WHO Guidance on Ending the Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young Children regulate
the advertising and promotion of breastmilk substitutes (BMS) and commercially produced complementary food (CPCF).
However, there is often little evidence in-country on the types of CPCF and commercial snack and beverage products
available in retail locations, the extent to which these products are explicitly promoted to caregivers of young children, and
how these products are used and perceived by caregivers.
Assessing the availability, promotion and perception of CPCF, snacks, and beverages is a critical component of a situation
analysis on the drivers of young children’s diets. Key areas that warrant investigation, and methods that have been tested
for their exploration, are summarized below:

1. Availability of and promotional practices for CPCF
and commercial snack and beverage products in
retail locations (point-of-sale)

2. Caregiver perceptions and factors influencing the
use and feeding of CPCF and commercial snacks and
beverages

Assessing the extent to which these products are available
and promoted in retail locations can help to estimate the
likelihood of children’s exposure (directly and indirectly)
to marketing of nutrient-poor snack foods and beverages.
Further, understanding the extent of marketing in these
retail locations is necessary for the development and
strengthening of national regulations on inappropriate
promotion of foods.49 Illustrative research questions are
listed below, which could be further explored based on
context.

Understanding the drivers behind caregiver decisions to
purchase and use these products can help identify ways to
curb consumption rates.50 Illustrative research questions
are listed below, which could be further explored based on
context.

Research questions:
• Types of CPCF and commercial snack and beverage
products available in retail locations.
• Target age groups of products promoted.
• Scale and type of promotional activities used to market
CPCF and commercial snack and beverage products to
caregivers and young children.
• Nutrient profiles of the CPCF and commercial snack and
beverage products sold.
• Retailers’ interest in actively promoting healthy foods.

Methods:
• Scan of retail locations and market profiling. This
includes the sampling of different retail locations (from
small, informal shops to large grocery stores) and
collecting data in these locations on product availability,
type and quality. Further, promotional activities within
retail locations can be observed, categorized and
recorded during data collection.49
• Structured or semi-structured interviews may also be
conducted with retailers and consumers on promotional
activities.

Research questions:

• Profile of caregivers’ use of CPCF and commercial
snack and beverage products for feeding children.
• Rationale for providing CPCF and commercial snack and
beverage products to children.
• Caregiver opinions on quality and utility of different
types of CPCF and commercial snack and beverage
products.
• Factors that influence purchasing CPCF and commercial
snack and beverage products.
• Factors that influence feeding CPCF and commercial
snack and beverage products to children.

Methods:

• A mixed-methods approach can be employed, utilizing
both qualitative and quantitative methods.
• Focus group discussions and participatory exercises
with caregivers (non-working mothers, working
mothers, and grandmothers or other family caregivers).
• In-depth interviews with key informants.
• Cross-sectional survey of caregivers with infants and
young children.50

Further information and examples of relevant research topics and methods to assess the availability, promotion and
perception of CPCF, snacks and beverages can be found in various Assessment and Research on Child Feeding (ARCH)
publications (see: https://archnutrition.org/resources/ ).

Improving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period   67

Annex 6: Illustrative results matrix to guide monitoring
and evaluation to improve children’s diets
A results matrix articulating identified indicators at impact,
outcome and output level serves as a useful tool to
facilitate monitoring, evaluation and learning as part of
complementary feeding programmes. An illustrative results
matrix with generic indicators at all levels is presented
below. The matrix lists output indicators by each of the
drivers and is linked to selected strategic actions in the
complementary feeding action frameworks. Countries
should tailor this results matrix to their specific needs,
programme objectives and actions, and local context.*
IMPACT

A results matrix should also include targets for indicators,
timelines for progress, frequency of data collection/
reporting, data collection instruments, and the responsible
organization for data collection. Indicators for the food,
health, water and sanitation, and social protection
system that are relevant to complementary feeding
may already be collected and reported by other sectors.
These sectors should therefore be consulted during the
process of developing monitoring and evaluation activities
and a results matrix to ensure complementarity and
avoid duplication.

* UNICEF country nutrition programmes collect and report some of these indicators presented in the proposed results matrix using internal data
reporting platforms such as the results assessment module (RAM), NutriDash, strategic monitoring questions (SMQs), and the global UNICEF
database on infant and young child feeding indicators. UNICEF guidance on RAM standard indicators provides further details on measuring and
reporting on nutrition indicators.
** Some of these additional indicators have been recently defined and are therefore not yet available for surveys. Other indicators can be used in
lieu until these become available.

Internal monitoring of strategic actions and
measuring progress

Water and sanitation system

Process level indicators should also be developed for
internal monitoring of activities required to achieve planned
outputs, outcomes and impact. Progress on strategic
actions should be monitored internally to track execution
against planned objectives and timelines. Such internal
monitoring enables programme managers to assess and
identify implementation issues and take corrective action
in a timely manner. Process indicators should be defined
based on the country-specific actions implemented across
systems. Some examples of process indicators related
to the four systems are listed below:

• Review and assessment of national SBCC strategies and
plans on inclusion of actions to improve young children’s
diets is conducted.

Food system

• Assessments of markets and marketing practices to
understand barriers to availability and sustained access
to safe, affordable and nutritious complementary foods
are conducted.
• Mapping of policies, legislation and stakeholders
influencing food availability, food cost and the food
environment is conducted.
• Partnerships/working groups with Ministry of Agriculture
and relevant partners to enable strengthened policy,
SBCC and programme linkages with nutrition are
established and functional.
• Formative research to inform the design and/or scale-up
of community-based approaches to address challenges
and gaps in food availability, affordability or the food
environment is conducted.

Health system

• Health and nutrition-related policies, legislation,
strategies, plans and budgets at national level are
reviewed and gaps and actions to improve child diets are
identified.
• Complementary feeding indicators for inclusion in
national information monitoring systems are developed.
• Formative research to inform the design/scale-up of
community-based and health system approaches to
improve access to nutritious, safe and affordable foods
for children is conducted.
• Trainings for facility and community health and nutrition
workers to deliver complementary feeding counselling
services are conducted.

70   UNICEF Programming Guidance

• Review and assessment of WASH, nutrition and health
policies, strategies and plans is conducted.

• Mapping of WASH service availability and access
against stunting prevalence and WASH-related disease
prevalence is conducted.
• Nutrition-sensitive WASH indicators for inclusion in
national information monitoring systems are developed.

Social protection system

• Mapping and review of social protection policies,
services, budgets and delivery platforms that influence
access to nutritious foods is conducted.
• Partnerships/working groups with relevant social
protection government entities and partners to enable
strengthened policy, SBCC and programme linkages with
nutrition are established.
• Formative research on critical bottlenecks in household
level access, availability and affordability of nutritious
foods in vulnerable communities is conducted.
