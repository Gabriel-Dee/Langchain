       "'A bot (short for \"robot\") is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that interacts with humans or other machines through text or voice commands. Bots can be found in various forms, such as:\\n\\n1. **Chatbots**: These are computer programs that simulate human-like conversations with users. They can answer questions, provide information, or even help with tasks like booking flights or making appointments.\\n2. **Virtual assistants**: Examples include Amazon\\'s Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple\\'s Siri. These bots understand voice commands and perform tasks like playing music, setting reminders, or controlling smart home devices.\\n3. **Social media bots**: These automate tasks on social media platforms, such as posting updates, responding to comments, or monitoring brand mentions.\\n4. **Customer service bots**: Designed to assist customers with inquiries, complaints, or issues, these bots can provide immediate support and help resolve problems more efficiently than human customer support teams.\\n5. **Game bots**: These participate in online games, like multiplayer video games or role-playing games (RPGs). They can be opponents, teammates, or even game masters.\\n6. **Research bots**: These are designed for scientific research, such as analyzing data, classifying objects, or generating hypotheses.\\n\\nBots typically work by:\\n\\n1. Processing natural language inputs (text or voice)\\n2. Understanding the intent behind the input\\n3. Retrieving relevant information or performing a task\\n4. Generating a response to provide feedback or answer questions\\n\\nTo create a bot, developers use programming languages like Python, Java, or C++ and integrate them with AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or IBM Watson. The complexity of bot development depends on the specific goals and requirements.\\n\\nSo, in short, bots are AI-powered programs that interact with humans or machines through text or voice commands, helping to automate tasks, provide information, or even entertain us!'"

— Page iv\\n\\n\\x0cMessage From the\\nSecretaries\\nWe are pleased to present the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025. This edition marks the first time the\\nGuidelines provide recommendations by life stage, from birth through older adulthood.\\nEach stage of life is distinct and has unique needs that affect health and disease risk. Early food preferences influence\\nfood and beverage choices later. And the science has evolved to focus on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern\\nover time. The science also shows it’s never too late to start and maintain a healthy dietary pattern, which can yield\\nhealth benefits in the short term and cumulatively over years. This new edition of the Dietary Guidelines includes\\nspecific recommendations for all life stages, now including infants and toddlers, and pregnant and lactating women.\\nWe are excited this is the first edition to provide guidance for every life stage.\\nThis edition of the Dietary Guidelines is grounded in robust scientific reviews of the current body of evidence on key\\nnutrition and health topics for each life stage. We thank the 20 distinguished scientists on the 2020 Dietary Guidelines\\nAdvisory Committee for their expertise and dedication in conducting an independent scientific review that was\\ncharacterized by more transparency and public participation throughout the process than ever before. The Committee’s\\nwork culminated in a comprehensive scientific report on the current state of nutrition science and provided advice\\nto the Departments for our development of this 9th edition of the Dietary Guidelines. The Committee also included\\nimportant considerations for future research, such as a need to reconsider the Dietary Reference Intakes. The U.S. and\\nCanadian Dietary Reference Intake Steering Committees are currently developing plans to re-examine energy, protein,\\nfat, and carbohydrate–the timeline for these macronutrient reviews has not been established. USDA and HHS are\\nlooking forward to jointly funding the work to help guide our Departments’ research agendas in the coming years.\\nWith the science must come practice—that is, making food and beverage choices that align with the Dietary Guidelines.\\nUsing the new edition of the Dietary Guidelines, we hope Americans can find ways to “Start Simple” and incorporate\\nmodest changes each day that push Americans closer to meeting the recommendations. It’s more important than\\never to make healthy eating a priority in the United States. With the release of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,\\n2020-2025, we have an important call to action for you as health professionals and policymakers. We are asking you to\\nhelp the public “make every bite count with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.” Help people make food and beverage\\nchoices that are rich in nutrition—individual choices that can become a healthy routine over time, choices they can\\nenjoy in good health for many years to come.\\nThank you for all you do to help Americans make strides toward aligning closer to the Dietary Guidelines as we all work\\ntogether to help the public lead healthier lives.\\n/Sonny Perdue/\\nSonny Perdue\\nSecretary,\\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\\n\\nPage v | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025\\n\\n/Alex M.

The scientific\\nconnection between food and health has been well\\ndocumented for many decades, with substantial and\\nincreasingly robust evidence showing that a healthy\\nlifestyle—including following a healthy dietary pattern—\\ncan help people achieve and maintain good health\\nand reduce the risk of chronic diseases throughout\\nall stages of the lifespan: infancy and toddlerhood,\\nchildhood and adolescence, adulthood, pregnancy and\\nlactation, and older adulthood. The core elements of\\na healthy dietary pattern are remarkably consistent\\nacross the lifespan and across health outcomes.\\n\\nResearch Act, which states that at least every 5 years,\\nthe U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and of\\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) must jointly publish\\na report containing nutritional and dietary information\\nand guidelines for the general public. The statute\\n(Public Law 101-445, 7 United States Code 5341 et\\nseq.) requires that the Dietary Guidelines be based on\\nthe preponderance of current scientific and medical\\nknowledge. The 2020-2025 edition of the Dietary\\nGuidelines builds from the 2015 edition, with revisions\\ngrounded in the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary\\nGuidelines Advisory Committee and consideration of\\nFederal agency and public comments.\\n\\nSince the first edition was published in 1980, the Dietary\\nGuidelines for Americans have provided science-based\\nadvice on what to eat and drink to promote health,\\nreduce risk of chronic disease, and meet nutrient needs.\\nPublication of the Dietary Guidelines is required under\\nthe 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and Related\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is designed for policymakers\\nand nutrition and health professionals to help all\\nindividuals and their families consume a healthy,\\nnutritionally adequate diet. The information in\\nthe Dietary Guidelines is used to develop, implement,\\nand evaluate Federal food, nutrition, and health policies\\n\\nPage vii | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary\\n\\n\\x0cand programs. It also is the basis for Federal nutrition\\neducation materials designed for the public and for\\nthe nutrition education components of USDA and\\nHHS nutrition programs. State and local governments,\\nschools, the food industry, other businesses,\\ncommunity groups, and media also use Dietary\\nGuidelines information to develop programs, policies,\\nand communication for the general public.\\nThe aim of the Dietary Guidelines is to promote health\\nand prevent disease. Because of this public health\\norientation, the Dietary Guidelines is not intended\\nto contain clinical guidelines for treating chronic\\ndiseases. Chronic diseases result from a complex\\nmix of genetic, biological, behavioral, socioeconomic,\\nand environmental factors, and people with these\\nconditions have unique health care requirements that\\nrequire careful oversight by a health professional. The\\nbody of scientific evidence on diet and health reviewed\\nto inform the Dietary Guidelines is representative of the\\nU.S. population—it includes people who are healthy,\\npeople at risk for diet-related chronic conditions and\\ndiseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2\\ndiabetes, and obesity, and some people who are living\\nwith one or more of these diet-related chronic illnesses.\\nAt the same time, it is essential that Federal agencies,\\nmedical organizations, and health professionals adapt\\nthe Dietary Guidelines to meet the specific needs of\\ntheir patients as part of an individual, multifaceted\\ntreatment plan for the specific chronic disease.\\n\\nConsistent\\nand Evolving\\n\\nThe second is its focus on dietary patterns.\\nResearchers and public health experts, including\\nregistered dietitians, understand that nutrients and\\nfoods are not consumed in isolation. Rather, people\\nconsume them in various combinations over time—a\\ndietary pattern—and these foods and beverages act\\nsynergistically to affect health. The Dietary Guidelines\\nfor Americans, 2015-2020 puts this understanding\\ninto action by focusing its recommendations on\\nconsuming a healthy dietary pattern. The 2020-2025\\nDietary Guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the\\nimportance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole—\\nrather than on individual nutrients, foods, or food\\ngroups in isolation.\\nThe third is its focus on a lifespan approach. This\\nedition of the Dietary Guidelines highlights the\\nimportance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns at\\nevery life stage from infancy through older adulthood. It\\nprovides recommendations for healthy dietary patterns\\nby life stage, identifying needs specific to each life stage\\nand considering healthy dietary pattern characteristics\\nthat should be carried forward into the next stage of\\nlife. For the first time since the 1985 edition, the 20202025 Dietary Guidelines includes recommendations for\\nhealthy dietary patterns for infants and toddlers.\\n\\nThe Guidelines\\n\\nAlthough many recommendations have remained\\nrelatively consistent over time, the Dietary Guidelines\\nalso has built upon previous editions and evolved as\\nscientific knowledge has grown. The Dietary Guidelines\\nfor Americans, 2020-2025 reflects this in three\\nimportant ways:\\nThe first is its recognition that diet-related chronic\\ndiseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2\\ndiabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer, are very\\nprevalent among Americans and pose a major public\\nhealth problem. Today, more than half of adults\\nhave one or more diet-related chronic diseases. As a\\nresult, recent editions of the Dietary Guidelines have\\nfocused on healthy individuals, as well as those with\\noverweight or obesity and those who are at risk of\\n\\nchronic disease. A fundamental premise of the 20202025 Dietary Guidelines is that just about everyone,\\nno matter their health status, can benefit from shifting\\nfood and beverage choices to better support healthy\\ndietary patterns.\\n\\nThe 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines provides four\\noverarching Guidelines that encourage healthy eating\\npatterns at each stage of life and recognize that\\nindividuals will need to make shifts in their food and\\nbeverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern. The\\nGuidelines also explicitly emphasize that a healthy\\ndietary pattern is not a rigid prescription. Rather, the\\nGuidelines are a customizable framework of core\\nelements within which individuals make tailored and\\naffordable choices that meet their personal, cultural,\\nand traditional preferences. Several examples of\\nhealthy dietary patterns that translate and integrate\\nthe recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat\\nare provided. The Guidelines are supported by Key\\nRecommendations that provide further guidance on\\nhealthy eating across the lifespan.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary | Page viii\\n\\n\\x0cThe Guidelines\\n\\nMake every bite count with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\\nHere’s how:\\n\\n1\\n\\nFollow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage.\\n\\nAt every life stage—infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, pregnancy, lactation, and\\nolder adulthood—it is never too early or too late to eat healthfully.\\n• For about the first 6 months of life, exclusively feed infants human milk. Continue to feed infants\\nhuman milk through at least the first year of life, and longer if desired. Feed infants iron-fortified infant\\nformula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable. Provide infants with supplemental\\nvitamin D beginning soon after birth.\\n• At about 6 months, introduce infants to nutrient-dense complementary foods. Introduce infants to\\npotentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods. Encourage infants and toddlers\\nto consume a variety of foods from all food groups. Include foods rich in iron and zinc, particularly for\\ninfants fed human milk.\\n• From 12 months through older adulthood, follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet\\nnutrient needs, help achieve a healthy body weight, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\n2\\n\\nCustomize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect\\npersonal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations.\\n\\nA healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age, race, or ethnicity, or current health\\nstatus. The Dietary Guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and\\npreferences, as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the United States.\\n\\n3\\n\\nFocus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages,\\nand stay within calorie limits.\\n\\nAn underlying premise of the Dietary Guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from\\nfoods and beverages—specifically, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. Nutrient-dense foods provide\\nvitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting components and have no or little added sugars, saturated\\nfat, and sodium. A healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense forms of foods and beverages across\\nall food groups, in recommended amounts, and within calorie limits.\\nThe core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include:\\n• Vegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and\\nother vegetables\\n• Fruits, especially whole fruit\\n• Grains, at least half of which are whole grain\\n• Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or lactose-free versions and fortified\\nsoy beverages and yogurt as alternatives\\n• Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts,\\nseeds, and soy products\\n• Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts\\n\\nPage ix | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nLimit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and\\nlimit alcoholic beverages.\\n\\nAt every life stage, meeting food group recommendations—even with nutrient-dense choices—requires most\\nof a person’s daily calorie needs and sodium limits. A healthy dietary pattern doesn’t have much room for\\nextra added sugars, saturated fat, or sodium—or for alcoholic beverages. A small amount of added sugars,\\nsaturated fat, or sodium can be added to nutrient-dense foods and beverages to help meet food group\\nrecommendations, but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited. Limits are:\\n• Added sugars—Less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2. Avoid foods and beverages with\\nadded sugars for those younger than age 2.\\n• Saturated fat—Less than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2.\\n• Sodium—Less than 2,300 milligrams per day—and even less for children younger than age 14.\\n• Alcoholic beverages—Adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink, or to drink in moderation by\\nlimiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is\\nconsumed. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink\\nalcohol, such as women who are pregnant.\\n\\nTerms to Know\\n\\nSeveral terms are used throughout\\nthe Dietary Guidelines and are\\nessential to understanding the\\nGuidelines and putting them into\\naction. These terms are defined here:\\n• Dietary pattern: It is the combination of\\nfoods and beverages that constitutes\\nan individual’s complete dietary intake\\nover time. This may be a description of a\\ncustomary way of eating or a description\\nof a combination of foods recommended\\nfor consumption.\\n• Nutrient dense: Nutrient-dense foods\\nand beverages provide vitamins, minerals,\\nand other health-promoting components\\nand have little added sugars, saturated\\nfat, and sodium. Vegetables, fruits, whole\\ngrains, seafood, eggs, beans, peas, and\\nlentils, unsalted nuts and seeds, fat-free\\nand low-fat dairy products, and lean meats\\nand poultry—when prepared with no or little\\nadded sugars, saturated fat, and sodium—\\nare nutrient-dense foods.\\n\\nFor most individuals, no matter their age or health status,\\nachieving a healthy dietary pattern will require changes in\\nfood and beverage choices. Some of these changes can\\nbe accomplished by making simple substitutions, while\\nothers will require greater effort to accomplish. This edition\\nof the Dietary Guidelines presents overall guidance on\\nchoosing nutrient-dense foods and beverages in place of\\nless healthy choices and also discusses special nutrition\\nconsiderations for individuals at each life stage—infants\\nand toddlers, children and adolescents, adults, women who\\nare pregnant or lactating, and older adults.\\nAlthough individuals ultimately decide what and how much\\nto consume, their personal relationships; the settings in\\nwhich they live, learn, work, play, and gather; and other\\ncontextual factors—including their ability to consistently\\naccess healthy and affordable food—strongly influence\\ntheir choices. Health professionals, communities,\\nbusinesses and industries, organizations, government,\\nand other segments of society all have a role to play in\\nsupporting individuals and families in making choices\\nthat align with the Dietary Guidelines and ensuring that\\nall people have access to a healthy and affordable food\\nsupply. Resources, including Federal programs that support\\nhouseholds, regardless of size and make-up, in choosing\\na healthy diet and improving access to healthy food, are\\nhighlighted throughout this edition of the Dietary Guidelines\\nfor Americans.\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Executive Summary | Page x\\n\\n\\x0cPage 1 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction | Page 2\\n\\n\\x0cSetting the Stage\\n\\nT\\n\\nhe foods and beverages that people consume have a profound\\nimpact on their health. The scientific connection between food\\nand health has been well documented for many decades, with\\nsubstantial evidence showing that healthy dietary patterns can help\\npeople achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of\\nchronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan. Yet, Federal\\ndata show that from the first edition of the Dietary Guidelines for\\nAmericans in 1980 through today, Americans have fallen far short\\nof meeting its recommendations, and diet-related chronic disease\\nrates have risen to pervasive levels and continue to be a major public\\nhealth concern.\\nThe Dietary Guidelines is an important part of a complex,\\nmultifaceted approach to promote health and reduce\\nchronic disease risk. The Dietary Guidelines provides\\nscience-based advice on what to eat and drink to\\npromote health, help reduce risk of chronic disease,\\nand meet nutrient needs. The Dietary Guidelines is\\nthe foundation of Federal food, nutrition, and health\\npolicies and programs. An important audience is health\\nprofessionals and nutrition program administrators\\nwho work with the general public to help them\\nconsume a healthy and nutritionally adequate diet and\\nestablish policies and services to support these efforts.\\nComprehensive, coordinated strategies built on the\\nscience-based foundation of the Dietary Guidelines—and\\na commitment to drive these strategies over time across\\nsectors and settings—can help all Americans consume\\nhealthy dietary patterns, achieve and maintain good\\nhealth, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\\n\\nGrounded in Science and Focused on\\nPublic Health\\n\\nThe U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and of\\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) update the Dietary\\nGuidelines at least every 5 years, based on the current\\nscience. A fundamental premise of the Dietary Guidelines\\nis that everyone, no matter their age, race, or ethnicity,\\neconomic circumstances, or health status, can benefit\\nfrom shifting food and beverage choices to better\\nsupport healthy dietary patterns.\\n\\nPage 3 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction\\n\\n\\x0cTo make sure that the dietary advice provided in the\\nDietary Guidelines is aimed at improving public health,\\nthe science used to inform the Guidelines has examined\\ndiet through a lens of health promotion and disease\\nprevention and considered various segments of the\\nUnited States population, including ethnic populations\\nwho have disproportionately and/or historically been\\naffected by diet-related disparities. This means that\\npriority has been placed on scientific studies that\\nexamine the relationship between diet and health across\\nall life stages, in men, women, and children from diverse\\nracial and ethnic backgrounds, who are healthy or at risk\\nof chronic disease.\\nOver time, eating patterns in the United States have\\nremained far below Dietary Guidelines recommendations\\n(Figure I-1). Concurrently, it has become increasingly\\nclear that diet-related chronic diseases, such as\\ncardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, liver\\ndisease, some types of cancer, and dental caries, pose\\na major public health problem for Americans. Today,\\n\\n60 percent of adults have one or more diet-related chronic\\ndiseases (Table I-1). Given its aim to prevent further\\ndisease incidence by promoting health and reducing\\nchronic disease risk, the Dietary Guidelines focuses on\\nthe general public, including healthy individuals, as well\\nas those with overweight or obesity and those who are at\\nrisk of chronic disease. The importance of following the\\nDietary Guidelines across all life stages has been brought\\ninto focus even more with the emergence of COVID-19,\\nas people living with diet-related chronic conditions and\\ndiseases are at an increased risk of severe illness from\\nthe novel coronavirus.\\nGrounded in the current body of scientific evidence\\non diet and health that is relevant to all Americans,\\nthe Dietary Guidelines is a critically important tool for\\nhealth professionals, policymakers, and many other\\nprofessionals. It is designed to help people make food\\nand beverage choices all through life that are enjoyable\\nand affordable and that also promote health and help\\nprevent chronic disease.\\n\\nFigure I-1\\n\\nAdherence of the U.S. Population to the Dietary\\nGuidelines Over Time, as Measured by the Average Total\\nHealthy Eating Index-2015 Scores\\n\\nMaximum Total Score = 100\\n\\n100\\n80\\n\\n56\\n\\n57\\n\\n59\\n\\n60\\n\\n59\\n\\n59\\n\\n0\\n2005-2006\\n\\n2007-2008\\n\\n2009-2010\\n\\n2011-2012\\n\\n2013-2014\\n\\n2015-2016\\n\\n60\\n40\\n20\\n\\nNOTE: HEI-2015 total scores are out of 100 possible points.

Early\\nDietary Guidelines editions used evidence that examined\\nthe relationships between individual nutrients, foods,\\nand food groups and health outcomes. In recent years,\\nresearchers, public health experts, and registered\\ndietitians have acknowledged that nutrients and\\nfoods are not consumed in isolation. Rather, people\\nconsume them in various combinations over time—a\\ndietary pattern—and these foods and beverages act\\nsynergistically to affect health.\\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines put this understanding\\ninto action by focusing its recommendations on\\nconsuming a healthy dietary pattern. The 2020-2025\\nDietary Guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the\\nimportance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole—\\nrather than on individual nutrients or foods in isolation.\\nServing as a framework, the Guidelines’ dietary patterns\\napproach enables policymakers, programs, and health\\nprofessionals to help people personalize their food\\nand beverage choices to accommodate their wants\\nand needs, food preferences, cultural traditions and\\ncustoms, and budgetary considerations.\\n\\nHealthy Dietary Patterns at Every\\nLife Stage\\n\\nThe 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines takes the dietary\\npatterns approach one step further by focusing on\\nthe importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns\\nat every stage of life, from birth to older adulthood.\\nIt provides recommendations for healthy dietary\\npatterns by life stage, identifying needs specific to\\neach life stage and considering healthy dietary pattern\\ncharacteristics that should be carried forward into the\\nnext stage of life. And, for the first time since the 1985\\nedition, this edition of the Dietary Guidelines includes\\nrecommendations for infants and toddlers as well as\\ncontinuing the emphasis on healthy dietary patterns\\nduring pregnancy and lactation.\\nThis approach recognizes that each life stage is\\ndistinct—nutrient needs vary over the lifespan and\\neach life stage has unique implications for food and\\nbeverage choices and disease risk. At the same time, it\\nrecognizes an important continuity. Because early food\\npreferences influence later food choices, establishing a\\nhealthy dietary pattern early in life may have a beneficial\\nimpact on health promotion and disease prevention\\nover the course of decades.\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction | Page 6\\n\\n\\x0cDietary Guidelines for\\nAmericans: What It Is,\\nWhat It Is Not\\n\\npopulation, including healthy individuals and people\\nat risk of diet-related chronic conditions and diseases,\\nsuch as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or\\nobesity, and some people who are living with a dietrelated chronic illness.\\n\\nThe Dietary Guidelines translates the current science\\non diet and health into guidance to help people choose\\nfoods and beverages that comprise a healthy and\\nenjoyable dietary pattern—the “what” and “how much”\\nof foods and beverages to consume to achieve good\\nhealth, reduce risk of diet-related chronic diseases, and\\nmeet nutrient needs. The Dietary Guidelines is just one\\npiece of the nutrition guidance landscape, however.\\nOther guidance is designed to address requirements for\\nthe specific nutrients contained in foods and beverages\\nor to address treatments for individuals who have a\\nchronic disease. The following section describes the\\nrole of the Dietary Guidelines within this larger nutrition\\nguidance landscape.\\n\\nBecause of this public health orientation, the Dietary\\nGuidelines is not intended to be a clinical guideline\\nfor treating chronic diseases. However, the Dietary\\nGuidelines often has served as a reference for Federal,\\nmedical, voluntary, and patient care organizations\\nas they develop clinical nutrition guidance tailored\\nfor people living with a specific medical condition.\\nChronic diseases result from a complex mix of\\ngenetic, biological, behavioral, socioeconomic, and\\nenvironmental factors, and people with these conditions\\nhave unique health care requirements that require\\ncareful oversight by a health professional. Health\\nprofessionals can adapt the Dietary Guidelines to\\nmeet the specific needs of their patients with chronic\\ndiseases, as part of a multi-faceted treatment plan.\\n\\nQuantitative Guidance on Foods,\\nNot Nutrient Requirements\\n\\nNutrient requirements are established and updated\\nby the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,\\nand Medicine. At the request of the U.S. and Canadian\\nFederal Governments, the Academies set the\\nquantitative requirements or limits—known as Dietary\\nReference Intakes (DRI)—on nutrients, which include\\nmacronutrients (i.e., protein, carbohydrates, and fats),\\nvitamins and minerals (e.g., vitamin C, iron, and sodium),\\nand food components (e.g., dietary fiber).\\nBecause foods provide an array of nutrients and other\\ncomponents that have benefits for health, nutritional\\nneeds should be met primarily through foods. Thus,\\nthe Dietary Guidelines translates the Academies’\\nnutrient requirements into food and beverage\\nrecommendations. The Dietary Guidelines recognizes,\\nthough, that in some cases, fortified foods and\\ndietary supplements are useful when it is not possible\\notherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g.,\\nduring specific life stages such as pregnancy).\\n\\nHealth Promotion, Not Disease Treatment\\nAt its core, the Dietary Guidelines has a public health\\nmission—that is, health promotion and disease\\nprevention. Medical and nutrition professionals may\\nuse or adapt the Dietary Guidelines to encourage their\\npatients or clients to follow a healthy dietary pattern.\\nThe body of current scientific evidence on diet and\\nhealth reviewed to inform the Dietary Guidelines\\nincluded study participants who represent the U.S.\\n\\nPage 7 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction\\n\\nDeveloping the\\nDietary Guidelines\\nfor Americans\\nThe process to develop the Dietary Guidelines has\\nevolved over time, in step with developments in nutrition\\nscience, public health, and best practices in scientific\\nreview and guidance development. USDA and HHS work\\ntogether to determine the approach for each edition.\\nAs stipulated by law, USDA and HHS must update the\\nDietary Guidelines at least every 5 years. The Guidelines\\nmust be grounded in the body of scientific and medical\\nknowledge available at that time, not in individual\\nstudies or individual expert opinion. In establishing the\\nprocess for the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines, USDA\\nand HHS considered and integrated recommendations\\nfrom a comprehensive 2017 National Academies’\\nstudy, Review of the Process to Update the Dietary\\nGuidelines. Greater transparency figured prominently\\nin the Academies’ recommendations. As a result, in\\ndeveloping the 2020-2025 process, USDA and HHS\\nmade significant changes to increase transparency and\\npublic participation while maintaining the core element\\nof scientific integrity.\\nOne of these changes was the addition of a new stage\\nat the beginning of the process. Thus, the 2020-2025\\nprocess consisted of four stages: (1) identify the topics\\n\\n\\x0cStage 1:\\n\\nStage 2:\\n\\nStage 3:\\n\\nStage 4:\\n\\nIDENTIFY Topics\\nand Supporting\\nScientific Questions\\n\\nAPPOINT a Dietary\\nGuidelines Advisory\\nCommittee to\\nReview Evidence\\n\\nDEVELOP the\\nDietary Guidelines\\n\\nIMPLEMENT the\\nDietary Guidelines\\n\\nand supporting scientific questions to be examined;\\n(2) appoint a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee\\nto review current scientific evidence; (3) develop the\\nnew edition of the Dietary Guidelines; and (4) implement\\nthe Dietary Guidelines through Federal programs.\\nThe following information provides an overview of\\nthe 4-stage process. More details are available at\\nDietaryGuidelines.gov.\\n\\nand Federal agencies 30 days to view and provide\\ncomments. Following review of the comments, USDA\\nand HHS posted the final topics and questions, along\\nwith the public call for nominations to the 2020\\nCommittee. Having topics and questions identified\\nupfront helped inform the public’s nominations by\\ndefining which areas of nutrition expertise were needed\\non the Committee.\\n\\nStage 1: Identify Topics and Supporting\\nScientific Questions\\n\\nStage 2: Appoint a Dietary Guidelines\\nAdvisory Committee To Review Current\\nScientific Evidence\\n\\nThe Departments added a new step of identifying\\ntopics and scientific questions to begin the process\\nof developing the next Dietary Guidelines. This was\\ndone to promote a deliberate and transparent process,\\nbetter define the expertise needed on the Committee,\\nand ensure the scientific review conducted by the\\nCommittee would address Federal nutrition policy and\\nprogram needs and help manage resources.\\nIn consultation with agencies across the Federal\\nGovernment, USDA and HHS identified potential\\ntopics and supporting scientific questions that were of\\ngreatest importance and relevance to Federal nutrition\\nprograms, policies, and consumer education priorities.\\nCompared to all previous Dietary Guidelines processes,\\nthe topic areas for 2020-2025 expanded due to the\\nadded focus on infants and toddlers from birth through\\nage 23 months, as well as women who are pregnant.\\nThe Agricultural Act of 2014 mandated that, beginning\\nwith the 2020-2025 edition, the Dietary Guidelines\\nshould expand to include dietary guidance for these\\npopulations. Thus, the topics and questions—and areas\\nof expertise needed on the Committee—reflected\\nthis change.\\nThe Departments posted the topics and questions\\npublicly on DietaryGuidelines.gov, allowing the public\\n\\nIn the second stage, the Secretaries of USDA and HHS\\nappointed the Committee with the single, time-limited\\ntask of reviewing the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines,\\nexamining the evidence on the selected nutrition\\nand public health topics and scientific questions,\\nand providing independent, science-based advice\\nand recommendations to USDA and HHS. The 20\\nnationally recognized scientific experts appointed to\\nthe Committee represented a mix of practitioners,\\nepidemiologists, scientists, clinical trialists, and others\\nfrom every region of the United States.\\nThe use of a Federal advisory committee is a commonly\\nused best practice to ensure the Federal Government\\nseeks sound, external scientific advice to inform\\ndecisions. The Committee’s work concluded with its\\nscientific report submitted to the Secretaries of USDA\\nand HHS in June 2020.1 This report was not a draft of\\nthe Dietary Guidelines; it was a scientific document that\\ndetailed the Committee’s evidence review and provided\\nadvice to USDA and HHS.\\nThe Committee was divided into six subcommittees\\nto conduct its work: Dietary Patterns, Pregnancy and\\nLactation, Birth to Age 24 Months, Beverages and\\nAdded Sugars, Dietary Fats and Seafood, and Frequency\\n\\n1 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020.

The Committee also formed one cross-cutting\\nworking group—Data Analysis and Food Pattern Modeling—\\nto support work across the subcommittees.\\nThe Committee’s work had three defining characteristics:\\nthe use of three approaches to examine the evidence,\\nthe creation of transparent protocols before the evidence\\nreview began, and the development of scientific review\\nconclusion statements for the scientific reviews conducted.\\nTHREE APPROACHES TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE\\nThe 2020 Committee used three state-of-the-art approaches\\nto conduct its robust and rigorous reviews:\\nData analysis: Using Federal, nationally\\nrepresentative data, this approach provided\\ninsights into current eating habits of the U.S.\\npopulation and current diet-related chronic\\ndisease rates in the United States. These data\\nhelped make the Dietary Guidelines practical,\\nrelevant, and achievable.\\nThe Committee used data analysis to address\\nscientific questions that looked at current dietary\\npatterns and beverage consumption, current\\nintakes of food groups and nutrients, dietary\\ncomponents of public health concern, prevalence\\nof nutrition-related chronic health conditions, and\\nrelationships between eating habits and achieving\\nnutrient and food group recommendations.\\nNutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR):\\nSystematic reviews are research projects that\\nfollow meticulously defined protocols (i.e., plans)\\nto answer clearly formulated scientific questions\\nby searching for, evaluating, and synthesizing\\nall relevant, peer-reviewed studies. Systematic\\nreviews are considered a gold standard method to\\ninform development of evidence-based guidelines\\nby ensuring consideration of the strongest, most\\nappropriate body of evidence available on a topic.\\nUSDA’s Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review is a\\nteam of scientists who specializes in conducting\\nsystematic reviews focused on nutrition and\\ndisease prevention and evaluating scientific\\nevidence on nutrition topics relevant to Federal\\npolicy and programs. NESR used its rigorous,\\nprotocol-driven methodology to support the\\nCommittee in conducting its systematic reviews.\\nNew to the 2020 process, USDA and HHS added a\\nstep for peer review of the systematic reviews by\\nFederal scientists.\\nPage 9 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction\\n\\nFood pattern modeling: This type of analysis\\nillustrates how changes to the amounts or\\ntypes of foods and beverages in a dietary\\npattern might affect meeting nutrient needs\\nacross the U.S. population.\\nThe Committee used this method to assess\\npotential changes to the USDA Dietary\\nPatterns, which help meet the DRIs set by\\nthe National Academies, while taking into\\nconsideration current consumption in the\\nUnited States and the conclusions from\\nits systematic reviews. As with all food\\npattern modeling for the Dietary Guidelines,\\nthe results of the Committee’s food pattern\\nmodeling tests were interpreted in light of\\ntwo key assumptions. First, the modeling\\ntests were based on nutrient profiles of\\nnutrient-dense foods in the U.S. food supply\\nand U.S. population-based dietary data.\\nPopulation-based patterns articulate the\\nevidence on the relationships between diet\\nand health in ways that might be adopted by\\nthe U.S. public as a whole. Second, modeling\\ntests assumed population-wide compliance\\nwith all food intake recommendations.\\nAs with other types of modeling, the food\\npattern modeling is hypothetical and does\\nnot predict the behaviors of individuals.\\nEach of these approaches had its own rigorous,\\nprotocol-driven methodology, and each had a\\nunique, complementary role in examining the\\nscience. Additional detailed information is available\\nat DietaryGuidelines.gov and NESR.usda.gov.\\n\\n\\x0cTRANSPARENT PROTOCOLS FIRST, THEN REVIEW\\nTo answer each scientific question, the Committee\\nfirst created a protocol that described how the\\nCommittee would apply one of the three approaches\\nto examine the evidence related to that specific\\nquestion. The Committee created each protocol\\nbefore examining any evidence, and, for the first time,\\nthe protocols were posted online for the public as\\nthey were being developed. This enabled the public\\nto understand how a specific scientific question\\nwould be answered and to have the opportunity to\\nsubmit public comments before the Committee\\ncompleted the protocols and conducted its reviews\\nof the scientific evidence. Detailed information on the\\nCommittee’s review is documented in its scientific\\nreport, which is available on DietaryGuidelines.gov.\\n\\nHealth Status of Participants in\\nStudies Included in Nutrition\\nEvidence Systematic Reviews\\n\\nTo ensure that the Dietary Guidelines promotes\\nthe health of and reduce risk of disease among\\nall Americans, the evidence base that informs\\nthe Dietary Guidelines must comprise studies\\nconducted with people who are representative of\\nthe general public and must examine diet through\\na health promotion and disease prevention lens.\\nAs outlined in the Committee’s systematic review\\nprotocols, the Committee’s reviews included\\nstudies with participants who were healthy and/\\nor who were at risk of a chronic disease, including\\nparticipants with obesity, as well as studies\\nthat enrolled some participants with a disease.\\nBecause the Dietary Guidelines is not intended to\\nbe a clinical guideline for treating chronic diseases,\\nthe Committee excluded studies that enrolled only\\npatients with a disease with the intention to treat\\nthose individuals.\\nIn general, the majority of the reviews conducted\\nto inform the Dietary Guidelines included trials that\\nexclusively enrolled participants with overweight or\\nobesity, or who were at high risk of cardiovascular\\ndisease or type 2 diabetes, and observational\\nstudies that enrolled participants from a wide\\nrange of health and weight status, including those\\nwith healthy weight, overweight, or obesity. The\\nreviews included few studies that enrolled only\\nhealthy participants.\\nThus, the Dietary Guidelines are applicable to\\nthe overall U.S. population, including healthy\\nindividuals and people at risk of diet-related\\nchronic conditions and diseases, such as\\ncardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and\\nobesity. In addition, people living with a dietrelated chronic illness can benefit from a healthy\\ndietary pattern. The Dietary Guidelines can serve\\nas a reference for Federal, medical, voluntary,\\nand patient care organizations as they develop\\nnutrition guidance tailored for people living with a\\nspecific medical condition. Health professionals\\ncan adapt the Dietary Guidelines to meet the\\nspecific needs of their patients with chronic\\ndiseases, as part of a multifaceted treatment plan.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction | Page 10\\n\\n\\x0cCONCLUSION STATEMENTS FOR THE SCIENTIFIC\\nREVIEWS CONDUCTED\\nFor all topics and questions, regardless of the\\napproach used to identify and evaluate the scientific\\nevidence, the Committee developed conclusion\\nstatements. Each conclusion statement provided a\\nsuccinct answer to the specific question posed. The\\nCommittee took the strengths and limitations of the\\nevidence base into consideration when formulating\\nconclusion statements.\\nFor questions answered using NESR systematic\\nreviews, the conclusion statements included a grade\\nto indicate the strength of the evidence supporting\\nthe conclusion statement. The grades were Strong,\\nModerate, Limited, or Grade Not Assignable.\\n\\nGrading the strength of the evidence applied only to\\nquestions answered using NESR systematic reviews;\\nit did not apply to questions answered using data\\nanalysis or food pattern modeling. Therefore, data\\nanalysis and food pattern modeling conclusion\\nstatements were not graded.\\nAs it completed its work, the Committee looked\\nacross all of the conclusion statements to develop\\noverarching advice for USDA and HHS to consider as\\nthe Departments developed the next edition of the\\nDietary Guidelines.\\nUsing these three approaches, the Committee worked\\ncollaboratively for 16 months and deliberated on the\\nscientific reviews in six meetings, all of which were\\nopen to the public. Two of the six meetings included\\nan opportunity for the public to provide oral comments\\nto the Committee. An ongoing period for written public\\ncomments to the Committee spanned 15 months of\\nits work. And, for the first time, a final public meeting\\nwas included for the Committee to discuss its draft\\nscientific report 1 month before the final report was\\nposted for public comment.\\nIn addition to documenting its rigorous review of the\\nevidence to answer the scientific questions from USDA\\nand HHS and providing advice for the Departments’\\ndevelopment of the next Dietary Guidelines edition,\\nthe Committee provided recommendations for future\\nresearch. These research recommendations reflected\\nan acknowledgment that science in nutrition, diet, and\\nhealth associations continues to evolve, and that new\\nfindings build on and enhance existing evidence.\\nUpon submitting its final scientific report to the USDA\\nand HHS Secretaries, the Committee disbanded. The\\nDepartments then posted the scientific report and\\nasked the public for comments. The Departments\\nreceived written comments on the report over a\\n30-day period and also held an online meeting to\\nhear oral comments.\\n\\nStage 3: Develop the Dietary Guidelines\\n\\nEach edition of the Dietary Guidelines builds on the\\npreceding edition, with the scientific justification\\nfor revisions informed by the Committee’s scientific\\nreport and consideration of public and Federal agency\\ncomments. As with previous editions, development of\\nthe 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines involved a step-bystep process of writing, review, and revision conducted\\nby a writing team of Federal staff from USDA and HHS.\\n\\nPage 11 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction\\n\\n\\x0cThe writing team included Federal nutrition scientists\\nwith expertise in the Dietary Guidelines and related\\nresearch and programs as well as specialists with\\nexpertise in communicating nutrition information.\\nKey tenets of writing the Dietary Guidelines are that\\nit must:\\n• Represent the totality of the evidence examined\\n• Address the needs of Federal programs\\n• Reduce unintended consequences\\n• Follow best practices for developing guidelines\\n• Use plain language\\nThe draft Dietary Guidelines went through internal and\\nexternal review. Ultimately, the document was reviewed\\nby all Agencies with nutrition policies and programs\\nacross USDA and HHS, such as USDA’s Food and\\nNutrition Service and its Food Safety and Inspection\\nService, and HHS’ National Institutes of Health, Food and\\nDrug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control\\nand Prevention. The draft Dietary Guidelines also went\\nthrough an external expert peer review to ensure that it\\naccurately reflected the body of evidence documented in\\nthe Committee’s scientific report.\\n\\nThis process culminated with approval by the\\nSecretaries of USDA and HHS. After approval by the\\nSecretaries, the Departments released the Dietary\\nGuidelines to Federal agencies and the public for\\nimplementation across programs and through\\neducational activities.\\n\\nStage 4: Implement the Dietary Guidelines\\n\\nThe U.S. Government uses the Dietary Guidelines as\\nthe basis of its food assistance and meal programs,\\nnutrition education efforts, and decisions about national\\nhealth objectives. For example, the National School\\nLunch Program and the Older Americans Act Nutrition\\nProgram incorporate the Dietary Guidelines in menu\\nplanning; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program\\nfor Women, Infants, and Children applies the Dietary\\nGuidelines in its program and educational materials;\\nand the Healthy People objectives for the Nation include\\nobjectives based on the Dietary Guidelines.\\nThe Dietary Guidelines also provides a critical structure\\nfor State and local public health promotion and\\ndisease prevention initiatives. In addition, it provides\\nfoundational, evidence-based nutrition guidance for\\nuse by individuals and those who serve them in public\\nand private settings, including health professionals,\\npublic health and social service agencies, health care\\nand educational institutions, researchers, agricultural\\nproducers, food and beverage manufacturers, and more.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Introduction | Page 12\\n\\n\\x0cImplementation of the Dietary Guidelines Through MyPlate\\n\\nUsing MyPlate as a Guide To Support Healthy\\nDietary Patterns\\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans is developed and written for a professional audience. Therefore, its\\ntranslation into actionable consumer messages and resources is crucial to help individuals, families, and\\ncommunities achieve healthy dietary patterns.\\nMyPlate is one example of consumer translation. Created to be used in various settings and adaptable\\nto meeting personal preferences, cultural foodways, traditions, and budget needs, MyPlate is used by\\nprofessionals across sectors to help people become more aware of and informed about making healthy food\\nand beverage choices over time. More information is available at MyPlate.gov.\\nFollowing a healthy dietary pattern from birth through older adulthood can have a profound impact on a person’s\\nlifelong health. The Dietary Guidelines provides the framework for following such a pattern. However, broad and\\nmultisector collaboration is needed to help people achieve that goal. Action on many fronts is needed to ensure\\nthat healthy dietary choices at home, school, work, and play are the affordable, accessible norm. Everyone has a\\nrole to play in helping all Americans shift to a healthy dietary pattern and achieve better health.\\n\\nTry the MyPlate Plan\\n\\nA healthy eating routine is important at every stage of life and can have positive effects that add up\\nover time. It’s important to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy or fortified soy alternatives,\\nand protein foods. When deciding what to eat or drink, choose options that are full of nutrients.\\nMake every bite count.\\nThink about how the following recommendations can come together over the course of your day or\\nweek to help you create a healthy eating routine:\\nMake half your plate\\nfruits & vegetables.\\n\\nTo learn what the\\nright amounts\\nare for you, try\\nthe personalized\\nMyPlate Plan.2\\n\\nFocus\\non whole\\nfruits.\\n\\nMake half\\nyour grains\\nwhole grains.\\n\\nVary your\\nveggies.\\n\\nVary your\\nprotein\\nroutine.\\n\\nBased on decades\\nof solid science,\\nMyPlate advice can\\nhelp you day to day\\nand over time.\\n\\nChoose foods and beverages with less\\nadded sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.\\n\\nThe benefits of healthy eating add up over time, bite by bite.\\nSmall changes matter.

This edition of the Dietary\\nGuidelines consists of an Executive Summary, this\\nIntroduction, six chapters, and three appendixes.\\n• Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across\\nthe Lifespan: The Guidelines and Key\\nRecommendations discusses the health\\nbenefits of lifelong healthy dietary choices and\\nexplains the four Guidelines and supporting Key\\nRecommendations. This chapter is the basis for\\nall the succeeding chapters. Chapters 2 through 6\\nshould be read in tandem with Chapter 1.\\n• Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers is the first of five\\nchapters that focus on healthy dietary patterns\\nfor a specific life stage. This edition of the Dietary\\nGuidelines is the first since the 1985 edition to\\nprovide guidance for infants and toddlers (birth\\nthrough age 23 months). The chapter provides\\nspecific key recommendations for this age\\ngroup, along with guidance on how to put these\\nrecommendations into action. The chapter closes\\nwith a Healthy Dietary Pattern during the second\\nyear of life and a look toward the next life stage—\\nChildren and Adolescents.\\n• Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents first sets\\nthe stage by describing nutrition issues specific\\nto children and adolescents ages 2 through 18. It\\nthen presents the recommended Healthy Dietary\\nPatterns for this age group, explains how current\\nintakes compare to recommendations, and\\ndiscusses special dietary guidance considerations\\nfor this life stage. The chapter concludes with\\na discussion of ways to support healthy dietary\\npatterns among children and adolescents and a\\nlook toward the next life stage—Adults.\\n• Chapter 4: Adults opens with a discussion of\\nselected nutrition issues that characterize the\\nadult life stage (ages 19 through 59). It then\\npresents the recommended Healthy Dietary\\n\\n1\\n\\nPatterns for this age group,\\nexplains how current intakes\\ncompare to recommendations,\\nand discusses special dietary\\n2\\nguidance considerations for\\nadults. The chapter concludes with\\nsuggestions for how to support healthy\\ndietary patterns among adults and a look\\ntoward two important adult life stages—Women\\nWho Are Pregnant or Lactating and Older Adults.\\n• Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant\\nor Lactating opens with a discussion of\\nselected nutrition issues important to this\\nstage of adult life.

Continue to feed infants human\\nmilk through at least the first year of life, and longer\\nif desired. Feed infants iron-fortified infant formula\\nduring the first year of life when human milk is\\nunavailable. Provide infants with supplemental vitamin\\nD beginning soon after birth.\\n• At about 6 months, introduce infants to nutrient-dense\\ncomplementary foods. Introduce infants to potentially\\nallergenic foods along with other complementary\\nfoods. Encourage infants and toddlers to consume a\\nvariety of foods from all food groups. Include foods rich\\nin iron and zinc, particularly for infants fed human milk.\\n• From 12 months through older adulthood, follow a\\nhealthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet\\nnutrient needs, help achieve a healthy body weight,\\nand reduce the risk of chronic disease.\\n\\nGuideline\\n\\n2\\n\\nCustomize and enjoy nutrientdense food and beverage choices\\nto reflect personal preferences,\\ncultural traditions, and budgetary\\nconsiderations.\\n\\nA healthy dietary pattern can benefit\\nall individuals regardless of age, race, or\\nethnicity, or current health status. The Dietary\\nGuidelines provides a framework intended to be\\ncustomized to individual needs and preferences, as\\nwell as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the\\nUnited States.\\n\\nGuideline\\n\\nFocus on meeting food group\\nneeds with nutrient-dense foods\\nand beverages, and stay within\\ncalorie limits.\\n\\nAn underlying premise of the Dietary\\nGuidelines is that nutritional needs\\nshould be met primarily from foods and\\nbeverages—specifically, nutrient-dense foods\\nand beverages. Nutrient-dense foods provide vitamins,\\nminerals, and other health-promoting components and\\nhave no or little added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.\\nA healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense\\n3\\n\\nforms of foods and beverages across all food groups, in\\nrecommended amounts, and within calorie limits.\\nThe core elements that make up a healthy dietary\\npattern include:\\n• Vegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange;\\nbeans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and other vegetables\\n• Fruits, especially whole fruit\\n• Grains, at least half of which are whole grain\\n• Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and\\ncheese, and/or lactose-free versions and fortified soy\\nbeverages and yogurt as alternatives\\n• Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs;\\nseafood; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and\\nsoy products\\n• Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as\\nseafood and nuts\\n\\nGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\nLimit foods and beverages higher\\nin added sugars, saturated fat,\\nand sodium, and limit alcoholic\\nbeverages.\\n\\nAt every life stage, meeting food group\\nrecommendations—even with nutrientdense choices—requires most of a person’s\\ndaily calorie needs and sodium limits. A healthy\\ndietary pattern doesn’t have much room for extra\\nadded sugars, saturated fat, or sodium—or for alcoholic\\nbeverages. A small amount of added sugars, saturated\\nfat, or sodium can be added to nutrient-dense foods and\\nbeverages to help meet food group recommendations,\\nbut foods and beverages high in these components\\nshould be limited. Limits are:\\n• Added sugars—Less than 10 percent of calories per\\nday starting at age 2. Avoid foods and beverages with\\nadded sugars for those younger than age 2.\\n• Saturated fat—Less than 10 percent of calories per\\nday starting at age 2.\\n• Sodium—Less than 2,300 milligrams per day—and\\neven less for children younger than age 14.\\n• Alcoholic beverages—Adults of legal drinking age can\\nchoose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting\\nintake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink\\nor less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed.\\nDrinking less is better for health than drinking more.\\nThere are some adults who should not drink alcohol,\\nsuch as women who are pregnant.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 18\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n1\\n\\nGuideline 1\\n\\nFollow a Healthy Dietary Pattern at\\nEvery Life Stage\\nA fundamental premise of the Dietary Guidelines is\\nthat almost everyone, no matter an individual’s age,\\nrace, or ethnicity, or health status, can benefit from\\nshifting food and beverage choices to better support\\nhealthy dietary patterns.\\nHealthy eating starts at birth with the exclusive\\nconsumption of human milk, if possible, for about the\\nfirst 6 months. If human milk is unavailable, infants\\nshould be fed an iron-fortified commercial infant\\nformula (i.e., labeled “with iron”) regulated by the\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are\\nbased on standards that ensure nutrient content and\\nsafety. Healthy eating continues with the introduction\\nof complementary foods and beverages at about\\n6 months of age. By 12 months, infants should\\nmaintain their healthy eating as they transition to\\ndevelopmentally appropriate foods and beverages.\\nHealthy eating continues in each life stage thereafter.\\nEven though nutrient needs vary across life stages, the\\nfoods and beverages that individuals should eat over\\nthe lifespan are remarkably consistent.\\nThis chapter provides foundational guidance about\\nmaintaining a healthy dietary pattern across each life\\nstage—infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence,\\nadulthood, pregnancy, lactation, and older adulthood.\\nBecause the nutritional needs and transition of infants\\nand toddlers are unique, Chapter 2 provides a focused\\ndiscussion on this age group. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6\\nthen provide tailored nutrition information specific\\nto children and adolescents, adults, women who are\\npregnant or lactating, and older adults, respectively.\\n\\nWhat Is a Dietary Pattern?\\n\\nOver the course of any given day, week, or year,\\nindividuals consume foods and beverages1 in\\ncombination—a dietary pattern. A dietary pattern\\nrepresents the totality of what individuals habitually\\neat and drink, and the parts of the pattern act\\nsynergistically to affect health. As a result, the dietary\\npattern may better predict overall health status and\\ndisease risk than individual foods or nutrients.\\nA healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense\\n1\\n\\nforms of foods and beverages across all food groups,\\nin recommended amounts, and within calorie limits.\\nAchieving a healthy dietary pattern at each life stage\\nnot only supports health at that point in time, but also\\nsupports health in the next life stage and possibly for\\nfuture generations. If healthy dietary patterns can be\\nestablished early in life and sustained thereafter, the\\nimpact on health could be significant. Establishing\\nand maintaining a healthy dietary pattern can help\\nminimize diet-related chronic disease risk. Conversely,\\nconsuming foods and beverages that are not nutrientdense may lead to disease expression in later years.\\nHigh intakes of such foods (i.e., an unhealthy dietary\\npattern) throughout the lifespan can increase the risk of\\ndeveloping chronic diseases.\\nThe good news is that at any stage of life, individuals\\ncan make efforts to adopt a healthy dietary pattern\\nand improve their health. The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary\\nPattern, USDA’s primary Dietary Pattern, provides a\\nframework for healthy eating that all Americans can\\nfollow. It is based on the types and proportions of foods\\nAmericans of all ages, genders, races, and ethnicities\\ntypically consume, but in nutrient-dense forms and\\nappropriate amounts.\\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern is carried forward\\nfrom the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\\nThe 2,000-calorie level of the pattern is shown in\\nTable 1-1. The Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary\\nPattern and the Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern—\\nalso carried forward from the 2015-2020 Dietary\\nGuidelines for Americans—are variations of the Healthy\\nU.S.-Style Dietary Pattern that have the same core\\nelements. The USDA Dietary Patterns are described in\\nAppendix 3. USDA Dietary Patterns and are meant to\\nbe tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences\\nand used as guides to plan and serve meals for\\nindividuals, households, and in a variety of institutions\\nand other settings. The Dietary Approaches to Stop\\nHypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is an example of\\na healthy dietary pattern and has many of the same\\ncharacteristics as the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern.\\nAdditional details on DASH are available at nhlbi.nih.\\ngov/health-topics/dash-eating-plan.\\n\\nIf not specified explicitly, references to “foods” refer to “foods and beverages.”\\n\\nPage 19 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n1\\n\\nTable 1-1\\n\\nHealthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern at the 2,000-Calorie\\nLevel, With Daily or Weekly Amounts From Food Groups,\\nSubgroups, and Components\\nFOOD GROUP OR SUBGROUPa\\nVegetables (cup eq/day)\\n\\nDaily Amountb of Food From Each Group\\n\\n(Vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week.)\\n2½\\nVegetable Subgroups in Weekly Amounts\\n\\nDark-Green Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n1½\\n\\nRed and Orange Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n5½\\n\\nBeans, Peas, Lentils (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n1½\\n\\nStarchy Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n5\\n\\nOther Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n4\\n\\nFruits (cup eq/day)\\n\\n2\\n\\nGrains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n6\\n\\nWhole Grains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n≥3\\n\\nRefined Grains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n<3\\n\\nDairy (cup eq/day)\\n\\n3\\n\\nProtein Foods (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n5½\\nProtein Foods Subgroups in Weekly Amounts\\n\\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs (ounce eq/wk)\\n\\n26\\n\\nSeafood (ounce eq/wk)\\n\\n8\\n\\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products (ounce eq/wk)\\n\\n5\\n\\nOils (grams/day)\\n\\n27\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (kcal/day)c\\n\\n240\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (%/day)\\n\\n12%\\n\\na Definitions\\n\\nfor each food group and subgroup are provided throughout the chapter and are compiled in Appendix 3.\\n\\nb Food\\n\\ngroup amounts shown in cup or ounce equivalents (eq).

The amount of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and the amounts\\nof food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, saturated fat,\\nand/or alcohol, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.\\nNOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol; be within the Acceptable\\nMacronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total fats; and stay within calorie limits.

The science shows\\nthat consuming a healthy dietary pattern, meeting food\\ngroup and nutrient needs with nutrient-dense foods and\\nbeverages, and limiting intake of foods and beverages\\nthat are not nutrient-dense is related to many health\\nbenefits. Science also supports the idea that every life\\nstage provides an opportunity to make food choices\\nthat promote health and well-being, achieve and\\nmaintain appropriate weight status, and reduce risk of\\ndiet-related chronic disease.\\nThe science supporting the Dietary Guidelines is\\nextensively documented in the Scientific Report of the\\n2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which\\ndescribes the state of the science on key topics related\\nto diet and health. Outcomes with Strong or Moderate\\nevidence are provided in Figure 1-3. The report is\\navailable at DietaryGuidelines.gov.\\nEvidence on the association between dietary\\npatterns and reduced risk of diet-related chronic\\ndiseases has expanded in recent years and supports\\nthe use of dietary patterns as a foundation for\\nthe recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines\\nfor Americans, 2020-2025. Consistent evidence\\ndemonstrates that a healthy dietary pattern is\\nassociated with beneficial outcomes for all-cause\\nmortality, cardiovascular disease, overweight and\\nobesity, type 2 diabetes, bone health, and certain types\\nof cancer (breast and colorectal).\\nCommon characteristics of dietary patterns associated\\nwith positive health outcomes include relatively higher\\nintake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains,\\n\\nlow- or non-fat dairy, lean meats and poultry,\\nseafood, nuts, and unsaturated vegetable\\noils, and relatively lower consumption of red\\nand processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and\\nbeverages, and refined grains. The evidence examined\\nshowed broad representation across a number of\\npopulations and demographic groups. This suggests a\\nconsistent association no matter the region or cultural\\ncontext in which a healthy dietary pattern is consumed.\\nIn addition, dietary patterns characterized by higher\\nintake of red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened\\nfoods and beverages, and refined grains are, in and\\nof themselves, associated with detrimental health\\noutcomes. These findings are consistent with—and\\nbuild on—the evidence base that informed the 20152020 Dietary Guidelines.\\n\\nA Healthy Dietary Pattern Supports\\nAppropriate Calorie Levels\\n\\nThe total number of calories a person needs each day\\nvaries depending on a number of factors, namely the\\nperson’s age, sex, height, weight, level of physical activity,\\nand pregnancy or lactation status. Due to reductions\\nin basal metabolic rate that occur with aging, calorie\\nneeds generally decrease for adults as they age. In\\naddition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight affects\\nhow many calories should be consumed. Estimated\\namounts of calories needed based on age, sex, and\\nlevel of physical activity are provided in Appendix 2.\\nEstimated Calorie Needs, and estimated calorie needs\\nrelevant for different ages are provided in each life stage\\nchapter. These estimates are based on the Estimated\\nEnergy Requirement (EER) equations established by\\nthe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and\\nMedicine (National Academies) using reference heights\\n(average) and reference weights (healthy) for each\\nage-sex group. These amounts are estimates. The best\\nway to evaluate calorie intake, in comparison to calorie\\nneeds, is by measuring body weight status.\\n\\nRather than focus on weight status at any one point in life, the Dietary Guidelines supports\\nhealthy weight trajectories at each stage of life—appropriate weight gain during pregnancy\\nand postpartum weight loss, healthy growth and development from infancy through\\nadolescence, weight stability during mid-life, and healthy body composition late in life.\\nMeeting the Dietary Guidelines recommendations within calorie needs can help prevent\\nexcess weight gain at every life stage and support overall good health.\\n\\nPage 23 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n1\\n\\nFigure 1-3\\n\\nThe Science Underlying the Dietary Guidelines\\nDemonstrates That Healthy Eating Across the Lifespan\\nCan Promote Health and Reduce Risk of Chronic Disease\\nBirth Through\\n23 Months\\n• Lower risk\\nof overweight\\nand obesity\\n• Lower risk of\\ntype 1 diabetes\\n• Adequate iron status\\nand lower risk of\\niron deficiency\\n• Lower risk of\\npeanut allergy\\n• Lower risk\\nof asthma\\n\\nChildren and\\nAdolescents\\n• Lower adiposity\\n• Lower total and\\nlow-density lipoprotein\\n(LDL) cholesterol\\n\\nWomen Who\\nAre Pregnant or\\nLactating\\n• Favorable cognitive\\ndevelopment in\\nthe child\\n• Favorable folate\\nstatus in women\\nduring pregnancy\\nand lactation\\n\\nAdults, Including\\nOlder Adults\\n• Lower risk of\\nall-cause mortality\\n• Lower risk of\\ncardiovascular disease\\n• Lower risk of cardiovascular\\ndisease mortality\\n• Lower total and\\nLDL cholesterol\\n• Lower blood pressure\\n• Lower risk of obesity\\n• Lower body mass index,\\nwaist circumference, and\\nbody fat\\n• Lower risk of type 2 diabetes\\n• Lower risk of cancers of the\\nbreast, colon, and rectum\\n• Favorable bone health,\\nincluding lower risk of\\nhip fracture\\n\\nNOTE: The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee examined the evidence on diet and health across the lifespan.

An underlying premise of the Dietary Guidelines is that\\nnutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beverages—\\nspecifically, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. In some cases, when\\nmeeting nutrient needs is not otherwise possible, fortified foods and\\nnutrient-containing dietary supplements are useful. It is important to note\\nthat the nutrient density and healthfulness of what people eat and drink\\noften is determined ultimately by how a food item, dish, or meal is prepared,\\nat home and away from home or produced by a manufacturer. Based on\\nthe U.S. food supply and marketplace, the examples of healthy dietary\\npatterns in this edition are achievable through thoughtful, informed choices\\none decision, one meal, one day at a time—and consistently over time.\\nCHOOSE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FROM EACH FOOD GROUP\\nEnjoy different foods and beverages within each food group. This can\\nhelp meet nutrient needs—and also allows for flexibility so that the Dietary\\nGuidelines can be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences.\\nAll forms of foods, including fresh, canned, dried, frozen, and 100% juices,\\nin nutrient-dense forms, can be included in healthy dietary patterns.\\nPAY ATTENTION TO PORTION SIZE\\nPortion size is a term often used to describe the amount of a food or\\nbeverage served or consumed in one eating occasion. It is important to\\npay attention to portion size when making food and beverage choices,\\nparticularly for foods and beverages that are not nutrient-dense. A concept\\nthat can help people choose appropriate portions is serving size. This term\\nis included on the Nutrition Facts label and refers to the amount of a food\\nor beverage that is customarily consumed—it is not a recommendation\\nof how much to eat or drink. Consuming less than the stated serving\\nsize results in consuming fewer calories and other nutrients or food\\ncomponents. Some products may have multiple servings per package.\\n\\nPage 25 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n1\\n\\nMost Americans Do Not Follow a Healthy Dietary Pattern\\n\\nThe typical dietary patterns currently consumed by many in the United States do not align with the Dietary\\nGuidelines (Figure 1-4). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) is a measure of diet quality that can be used to assess\\ncompliance with the Dietary Guidelines. For Americans ages 2 and older, HEI-2015 scores indicate that intakes are\\nnot consistent with recommendations for a healthy dietary pattern. Average diet quality has slightly improved in\\nthe past 10 years, but the average score of 59 (on a scale from 0 to 100) indicates that people have much room for\\nimprovement. Differences in overall HEI scores are seen across age, sex, race-ethnic, and income subgroups and\\nby pregnancy and lactation status, though poor diet quality is observed across all groups. With each step closer to\\na diet that aligns with the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern, HEI scores will increase and risk for chronic\\ndisease will decrease.\\n\\nFigure 1-4\\n\\nAdherence of the U.S. Population to the Dietary Guidelines\\nAcross Life Stages, as Measured by Average Total Healthy\\nEating Index-2015 Scores\\n\\nMaximum Total Score = 100\\n\\n100\\n\\n80\\n\\n60\\n\\n61\\n\\n55\\n\\n52\\n\\n51\\n\\nAges 9-13\\n\\nAges 14-18\\n\\n56\\n\\n59\\n\\n63\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\n0\\n\\nAges 2-4\\n\\nAges 5-8\\n\\nAges 19-30\\n\\nAges 31-59\\n\\nAges 60+\\n\\nNOTE: HEI-2015 total scores are out of 100 possible points. A score of 100 indicates that recommendations on average were met or exceeded.\\nA higher total score indicates a higher quality diet.\\nData Source: Analysis of What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016, ages 2 and older, day 1 dietary intake data, weighted.\\n\\nIn addition, the high percentage of the population with overweight or obesity suggests that many people in the United\\nStates consume foods and beverages that contribute to a calorie imbalance, a situation more likely to occur with low\\nphysical activity. As shown in the Introduction, Table I-1, 74 percent of all adults and 40 percent of all children and\\nyouth in the United States have either overweight or obesity.\\nEven from the youngest ages, almost all Americans should shift to healthier food and beverage choices and\\nconsume smaller portions to achieve a healthy dietary pattern within an appropriate number of calories. It is never\\ntoo early or too late to improve intake and establish a healthy dietary pattern.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 26\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n2\\n\\nGuideline 2\\n\\nCustomize and Enjoy Food and Beverage\\nChoices to Reflect Personal Preferences,\\nCultural Traditions, and Budgetary\\nConsiderations\\nEating should be enjoyed, and\\na healthy dietary pattern can be\\nenjoyable, from early life to older\\nadulthood. The science reviewed\\nto inform the Dietary Guidelines\\nrepresents the diversity of\\nAmericans, including all ages and\\nlife stages, different racial\\nand ethnic backgrounds, and a\\nrange of socioeconomic statuses.\\nA healthy dietary pattern can\\nbenefit all individuals regardless\\nof age, race or ethnicity, or current\\nhealth status.\\nThe Dietary Guidelines provides\\na framework intended to be\\ncustomized to fit individual,\\nhousehold, and Federal program\\nparticipants’ preferences, as well\\nas the foodways of the diverse\\ncultures in the United States. The\\nU.S. population is diverse in myriad\\nways. The Dietary Guidelines\\nframework purposely provides\\nrecommendations by food groups\\nand subgroups—not specific\\nfoods and beverages—to avoid\\nbeing prescriptive. This framework\\napproach ensures that people can\\n“make it their own” by selecting\\nhealthy foods, beverages, meals,\\nand snacks specific to their needs\\nand preferences.\\nThe food groups include a broad\\nvariety of nutrient-dense food and\\nbeverage choices. In every setting,\\nacross all cultures, and at any age\\nor budget, there are foods and\\nbeverages that can fit within the\\nDietary Guidelines framework.\\n\\nStart with Personal Preferences\\n\\nExposure to different types of food is important\\nearly in life to better develop a child’s interest and\\nwillingness to eat and enjoy a variety of foods.\\nThrough each life stage that follows, a key starting\\npoint for establishing and maintaining a healthy\\ndietary pattern is to ensure that individual and/or\\nfamily preferences—in nutrient-dense forms—are\\nbuilt into day-to-day choices.\\n\\nIncorporate Cultural Traditions\\n\\nCultural background can have significant influence\\non food and beverage choices. Customizing the\\nDietary Guidelines framework to reflect specific\\ncultures and traditions is an important strategy\\nto help communities across the country eat and\\nenjoy a healthy dietary pattern. Nutrient-dense\\nculturally relevant foods and beverages are part\\nof all of the food groups. Spices and herbs can\\nhelp flavor foods when reducing added sugars,\\nsaturated fat, and sodium, and they also can add\\nto the enjoyment of nutrient-dense foods, dishes,\\nand meals that reflect specific cultures. Relying on\\nthe expertise of professionals in nutrition and in\\nspecific cultural foodways can help people prepare\\nfoods healthfully while retaining heritage.\\n\\nConsider Budget\\n\\nDespite a common perception that eating\\nhealthfully is expensive, a healthy dietary pattern\\ncan be affordable and fit within budgetary\\nconstraints. There are a range of strategies that\\ncan be used to help individuals and families follow\\na healthy dietary pattern including advanced\\nplanning; considering regional and seasonal food\\navailability; and incorporating a variety of fresh,\\nfrozen, dried, and canned options. The USDA\\nFood Plans—Thrifty, Low-Cost, Moderate-Cost,\\nand Liberal-Cost food plans—each represent\\na nutritious diet at a different cost level. These\\nplans are scheduled to be revised, with an updated\\nThrifty Food Plan published by the end of 2022 to\\nreflect this edition of the Dietary Guidelines and\\nupdated food availability and food cost data.\\n\\nPage 27 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n2\\n\\nFigure 1-5\\n\\nCustomizing the Dietary Guidelines Framework\\nThe Dietary Guidelines approach of providing a framework–not prescriptive details–ensures that its recommendations\\ncan “meet people where they are,” from personal preferences to cultural foodways, and including budgetary\\nconsiderations. The examples below are a sample of the range of options in each food group—to be eaten in nutrientdense forms. Additional examples are listed under Table A3-2 in Appendix 3.\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\n• Dark-Green Vegetables: All fresh, frozen, and canned darkgreen leafy vegetables and broccoli, cooked or raw: for\\nexample, amaranth leaves, bok choy, broccoli, chamnamul,\\nchard, collards, kale, mustard greens, poke greens, romaine\\nlettuce, spinach, taro leaves, turnip greens, and watercress.\\n• Red and Orange Vegetables: All fresh, frozen, and canned red\\nand orange vegetables or juice, cooked or raw: for example,\\ncalabaza, carrots, red or orange bell peppers, sweet potatoes,\\ntomatoes, 100% tomato juice, and winter squash.\\n• Beans, Peas, Lentils: All cooked from dry or canned beans,\\npeas, chickpeas, and lentils: for example, black beans,\\nblack-eyed peas, bayo beans, chickpeas (garbanzo beans),\\nedamame, kidney beans, lentils, lima beans, mung beans,\\npigeon peas, pinto beans, and split peas.

Recommended\\nIntake Ranges: Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Patterns (see Appendix 3).\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 30\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\nLearn More:\\n\\nTable A3-2 in Appendix\\n3 provides the food\\ngroup-based Healthy\\nU.S.-Style Dietary\\nPattern as a sample\\nframework. Information\\non what counts as a\\ncup- or ounce-equivalent\\nis also provided under\\nthis table in footnote c.\\n\\nAbout Beans, Peas, and Lentils\\n\\n“Beans, peas, and lentils” is a new name for the\\nvegetable subgroup formerly called “legumes\\n(beans and peas).” Beans, peas, and lentils, which\\nalso are known as pulses, include the dried edible\\nseeds of legumes. The foods in this vegetable\\nsubgroup have not changed. However, the new\\nname of the subgroup more accurately reflects\\nthe category of foods included. Beans include\\nvarieties such as kidney beans, pinto beans, white\\nbeans, black beans, lima beans, and fava beans.\\nAlso included are dried peas (e.g., chickpeas,\\nblack-eyed peas, pigeon peas, and split peas) and\\nlentils. Edamame, which is the soybean in the pod,\\nis counted in the beans, peas, and lentils subgroup\\neven though it is eaten fresh and not dried.\\nBecause beans, peas, and lentils have a similar\\nnutrient profile to foods in both the vegetable\\ngroup and the protein foods group, they may be\\nthought of as either a vegetable or a protein food\\nwhen aiming to meet recommended intakes.\\nGreen peas and green (string) beans are\\nnot counted in the beans, peas, and lentils\\nsubgroup because the nutrient content of these\\nvegetables is more similar to vegetables in other\\nsubgroups. Green peas, which are not dried before\\nconsumption, are grouped with starchy vegetables\\nand green beans are in the other vegetables\\nsubgroup, which includes onions, iceberg lettuce,\\ncelery, and cabbage. Generally, foods made from\\nprocessed soybeans are a part of the nuts, seeds\\nand soy products protein foods subgroup.\\n\\n3\\nThe following sections use the Healthy U.S.-Style\\nDietary Pattern to show how people can make shifts\\nin their choices to achieve a healthy dietary pattern.\\nInformation on the amounts to consume—in cup and ounce\\nequivalents—for each life stage is discussed in the subsequent\\nlife stage chapters and Appendix 3. USDA Dietary Patterns.\\n\\nEating an appropriate mix of foods from the food groups and\\nsubgroups—within an appropriate calorie level—is important\\nto promote health at each life stage. Each of the food groups\\nand their subgroups provides an array of nutrients, and the\\namounts recommended reflect eating patterns that have been\\nassociated with positive health outcomes. Foods from all of\\nthe food groups should be eaten in nutrient-dense forms. The\\nfollowing sections describe special considerations related to\\neach food group.\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nHealthy dietary patterns include a variety of vegetables\\nfrom all five vegetable subgroups—dark green; red and orange;\\nbeans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and other. These include\\nall fresh, frozen, canned, and dried options in cooked or raw\\nforms, including 100% vegetable juices. Vegetables in their\\nnutrient-dense forms have limited additions such as salt,\\nbutter, or creamy sauces. Examples of vegetables in each of\\nthe subgroups are available in Appendix 3.\\nAlmost 90 percent of the U.S. population does not meet\\nthe recommendation for vegetables. In addition, with\\nfew exceptions, the U.S. population does not meet intake\\nrecommendations for any of the vegetable subgroups. About\\n45 percent of all vegetables are eaten as a separate food item;\\nabout 40 percent as part of a mixed dish; and the remainder\\nare mostly consumed as snack foods and condiments.\\nVegetables, when consumed on their own, are generally\\nconsumed in forms with additional sodium either from salt\\nadded in cooking or added sauces such as soy sauce or\\nbottled stir-fry sauces. Many vegetables are consumed as part\\nof mixed dishes like sandwiches, pasta with a tomato-based\\nsauce, or casseroles that may have other ingredients that are\\nsources of saturated fat and/or sodium.\\nFor most individuals, following a healthy eating pattern will\\nrequire an increase in total vegetable intake and from all\\nvegetable subgroups, shifting to nutrient-dense forms, and\\nan increase in the variety of different vegetables consumed\\nover time. Vegetables can be part of many types of mixed\\ndishes, from burgers, sandwiches, and tacos, to pizza, stews,\\npasta dishes, grain-based casseroles, and soups. Strategies\\nto increase vegetable intake include increasing the vegetable\\ncontent of mixed dishes or eating less of a main dish to\\nallow for more vegetables as side dishes—keeping these\\nnutrient dense.\\n\\nPage 31 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n3\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nThe fruit food group includes whole fruits and 100% fruit\\njuice. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and\\ndried forms. Whole fruits can be eaten in various forms,\\nsuch as cut, sliced, diced, or cubed. At least half of the\\nrecommended amount of fruit should come from whole\\nfruit, rather than 100% juice. When juices are consumed,\\nthey should be 100% juice and always pasteurized or\\n100% juice diluted with water (without added sugars).\\nAlso, when selecting canned fruit, choose options\\nthat are canned with 100% juice or options lowest in\\nadded sugars.\\nAbout 80 percent of the U.S. population does not meet\\nfruit recommendations. Over 60 percent of all fruit\\nintake comes from whole forms—fresh, canned, frozen,\\nor dried—or 100% juice. Fruit is generally consumed in\\nnutrient-dense forms such as plain bananas, apples,\\noranges, or grapes. However, some fruit is consumed as\\npart of foods that may not be nutrient-dense, such as fruit\\npie or similar desserts.\\nMost people would benefit from increasing their intake\\nof fruit, mostly as whole fruits in nutrient-dense forms. A\\nwide variety of fruits are available in the U.S. marketplace,\\nsome year-round and others seasonally. Strategies to\\nhelp achieve this shift include choosing more whole fruits\\nas snacks and including them in meals.\\n\\nGrains\\n\\nHealthy dietary patterns include whole grains and limit\\nthe intake of refined grains. At least half of total grains\\nshould be whole grains. Individuals who eat refined grains\\nshould choose enriched grains. Individuals who consume\\nall of their grains as whole grains should include some\\nthat have been fortified with folic acid. Grain-based foods\\nin nutrient-dense forms limit the additions of added\\nsugars, saturated fat, and sodium.\\nA food is a 100% whole-grain food if the only grains\\nit contains are whole grains. A 1 ounce-equivalent of\\n100% whole grains has 16 grams of whole grains. The\\nrecommendation to consume at least half of total grains\\nas whole grains can be met in a number of ways.\\n• Choose 100% whole-grain foods for at least half of all\\ngrains consumed. The relative amount of whole grain in\\nthe food can be inferred by the placement of the grain\\nin the ingredient list. The whole grain should be the first\\ningredient—or the second ingredient after water. For\\nfoods with multiple whole-grain ingredients, they should\\nappear near the beginning of the ingredient list.\\n\\n• Choose products with at least 50 percent of the total\\nweight as whole-grain ingredients. If a food has at least\\n8 grams of whole grains per ounce-equivalent then half\\nof the grains are whole-grain ingredients.\\nMost Americans meet recommendations for total grain\\nintakes, although 98 percent fall below recommendations\\nfor whole grains and 74 percent exceed limits for refined\\ngrains. Almost half of all intake of refined grains is from\\nmixed dishes, such as sandwiches, burgers, tacos, pizza,\\nmacaroni and cheese, and spaghetti with meatballs.\\nAbout 20 percent of intake of refined grains comes from\\nsnacks and sweets, including crackers, pretzels, cakes,\\ncookies, and other grain desserts. The remaining refined\\ngrains are generally eaten as separate food items, such\\nas pancakes, cereals, breads, tortillas, pasta, or rice.\\nAbout 60 percent of whole-grain intake in the United\\nStates is from individual food items, mostly cereals and\\ncrackers, rather than mixed dishes. Grains are generally\\nconsumed in forms with higher amounts of sodium (e.g.,\\nbreads, tortillas, crackers) and added sugars (e.g., grainbased desserts, many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals)\\nrather than the nutrient-dense forms. Further, grains are\\noften consumed as part of mixed dishes, such as pasta\\ndishes, casseroles, and sandwiches that may have other\\ningredients that are not in nutrient-dense forms.\\nShifting from refined to whole-grain versions of\\ncommonly consumed foods—such as from white to\\n100% whole-wheat breads, and white to brown rice\\nwhere culturally appropriate—would increase whole-grain\\nintakes and lower refined grain intakes to help meet\\nrecommendations. Additionally, shifting to more nutrientdense forms of grains, such as ready-to-eat breakfast\\ncereals with less sugar, will help meet healthy dietary\\npatterns. With careful planning, limited amounts of salt,\\nbutter, or sources of added sugars can be used to make\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 32\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n3\\n\\nsome grain-based foods more palatable while staying\\nwithin calorie and nutrient limits, but most grains should\\nbe eaten in their most nutrient-dense forms. Reducing\\nintakes of cakes, cookies, and other grain desserts will\\nalso support reducing refined grain intakes and staying\\nwithin calorie needs.\\n\\n(including lactose-free milk), yogurt, and cheese, or\\nfrom fortified soy beverages or soy yogurt. Strategies\\nto increase dairy intake include drinking fat-free or\\nlow-fat milk or a fortified soy beverage with meals or\\nincorporating unsweetened fat-free or low-fat yogurt into\\nbreakfast or snacks.\\n\\nDairy and Fortified Soy Alternatives\\n\\nProtein Foods\\n\\nHealthy dietary patterns feature dairy, including fat-free\\nand low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, and cheese. Individuals\\nwho are lactose intolerant can choose low-lactose and\\nlactose-free dairy products. For individuals who choose\\ndairy alternatives, fortified soy beverages (commonly\\nknown as “soy milk”) and soy yogurt—which are fortified\\nwith calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin D—are included as\\npart of the dairy group because they are similar to milk\\nand yogurt based on nutrient composition and in their\\nuse in meals.\\nOther products sold as “milks” but made from plants\\n(e.g., almond, rice, coconut, oat, and hemp “milks”)\\nmay contain calcium and be consumed as a source\\nof calcium, but they are not included as part of the\\ndairy group because their overall nutritional content is\\nnot similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages.\\nTherefore, consuming these beverages does not\\ncontribute to meeting the dairy group recommendation.\\nAbout 90 percent of the U.S. population does not meet\\ndairy recommendations. The percent of Americans who\\ndrink milk as a beverage on a given day is 65 percent\\namong young children, 34 percent in adolescents, and\\nabout 20 percent for adults. Dairy is generally consumed\\nin forms with higher amounts of sodium (e.g., cheeses\\nas part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches, pizza, and\\npasta dishes) and saturated fat (e.g., higher fat milks and\\nyogurts) and can be a source of added sugars such as\\nflavored milk, ice cream, and sweetened yogurts.\\nMost individuals would benefit by increasing intake of\\ndairy in fat-free or low-fat forms, whether from milk\\n\\nHealthy dietary patterns include a variety of protein\\nfoods in nutrient-dense forms. The protein foods group\\ncomprises a broad group of foods from both animal and\\nplant sources, and includes several subgroups: meats,\\npoultry, and eggs; seafood; and nuts, seeds, and soy\\nproducts. As noted previously, beans, peas, and lentils\\nmay be considered a part of the protein foods group\\nas well as the vegetable group. Protein also is found\\nin some foods from other food groups, such as dairy.\\nMeats and poultry vary in fat content and include both\\nfresh and processed forms. Most intake of meats and\\npoultry should be from fresh, frozen, or canned, and\\nin lean forms (e.g., chicken breast or ground turkey)\\nversus processed meats (e.g., hot dogs, sausages, ham,\\nluncheon meats).\\nA healthy vegetarian dietary pattern can be achieved\\nby incorporating protein foods from plants. Compared\\nwith the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, the Healthy\\nVegetarian Dietary Pattern is higher in soy products\\n(particularly tofu and other processed soy products);\\nbeans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and whole\\ngrains. Inclusion of dairy and eggs make this an\\nexample of a lacto-ovo vegetarian pattern. Meats,\\npoultry, and seafood are not included.\\nSeafood, which includes fish and shellfish, is a protein\\nfoods subgroup that provides beneficial fatty acids (e.g.,\\neicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic\\nacid [DHA]). In addition, mercury, in the form of\\nmethylmercury, is found in seafood in varying levels.\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the\\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide\\n\\nPage 33 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\njoint advice regarding seafood consumption to limit\\nmethylmercury exposure for women who might become\\nor are pregnant or lactating and young children.2\\nSeafood choices higher in EPA and DHA and lower\\nin methylmercury are encouraged. Seafood varieties\\ncommonly consumed in the United States that are higher\\nin EPA and DHA and lower in methylmercury include\\nsalmon, anchovies, sardines, Pacific oysters, and trout.\\nTilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, and flounder are commonly\\nconsumed varieties that also are lower in methylmercury.\\nIntakes of protein foods are close to the target amounts,\\nbut many Americans do not meet recommendations\\nfor specific protein subgroups. About three-quarters\\nof Americans meet or exceed the recommendation for\\nmeats, poultry, and eggs. However, almost 90 percent\\ndo not meet the recommendation for seafood and more\\nthan half do not meet the recommendation for nuts,\\nseeds, and soy products. Slightly less than half (43%)\\nof all protein foods are consumed as a separate food\\nitem, such as a chicken breast, a steak, an egg, a fish\\n2\\n\\nfilet, or peanuts. About the same proportion are\\n3\\nconsumed as part of a mixed dish (48%), with\\nthe largest amount from sandwiches including\\nburgers and tacos. Protein foods are generally consumed\\nin forms with higher amounts of saturated fat or sodium\\nand often part of mixed dishes (e.g., sandwiches,\\ncasseroles, pasta dishes) that include other ingredients\\nthat are not in nutrient-dense forms.\\nShifts are needed within the protein foods group to\\nadd variety to subgroup intakes. Selecting from the\\nseafood subgroup or the beans, peas, and lentils\\nsubgroup more often could help meet recommendations\\nwhile still ensuring adequate protein consumption.\\nReplacing processed or high-fat meats (e.g., hot dogs,\\nsausages, bacon) with seafood could help lower intake\\nof saturated fat and sodium, nutrients that are often\\nconsumed in excess of recommended limits. Replacing\\nprocessed or high-fat meats with beans, peas, and lentils\\nwould have similar benefits, as well as increasing dietary\\nfiber, a dietary component of public health concern.\\n\\nAvailable at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.\\n\\nFollow Food Safety Recommendations\\n\\nAn important part of healthy eating is keeping food safe. Individuals in their own homes can help keep\\nfood safe by following safe food handling practices. Four basic food safety principles work together to\\nreduce the risk of foodborne illness—Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill.\\n1: Clean\\nWash hands and\\nsurfaces often.\\n\\n2: Separate\\nSeparate raw meats\\nfrom other foods.\\n\\n3: Cook\\nCook food to safe\\ninternal temperatures.\\n\\n4: Chill\\nRefrigerate foods\\npromptly.\\n\\nSome eating behaviors, such as consuming raw, undercooked, or unpasteurized food products, increase the risk of\\ncontracting a foodborne illness. Populations at increased risk of foodborne illness, or those preparing food for them,\\nshould use extra caution. These include women who are pregnant, young children, and older adults. Specific guidance\\nfor these life stages is discussed in subsequent chapters. Individuals with weakened immune systems are also at\\nincreased risk for foodborne illness. More information about food safety is available at:\\n• Your Gateway to Food Safety: foodsafety.gov\\n• USDA Food Safety Education campaigns: fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/teachothers/fsis-educational-campaigns\\n• Fight BAC!®: fightbac.org and for Babies and Toddlers: fightbac.org/kids/\\n• CDC 4 Steps to Food Safety: cdc.gov/foodsafety\\n• FDA: Buy, Store & Serve Safe Food at fda.gov/food/consumers/buy-store-serve-safe-food\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 34\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n3\\n\\nOils\\n\\nOils are important to consider as part of a healthy dietary pattern as they provide essential fatty acids. Commonly\\nconsumed oils include canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils. Oils also are naturally\\npresent in nuts, seeds, seafood, olives, and avocados. The fat in some tropical plants, such as coconut oil, palm\\nkernel oil, and palm oil, are not included in the oils category because they contain a higher percentage of saturated\\nfat than do other oils.\\nStrategies to shift intake include cooking with vegetable oil in place of fats high in saturated fat, including butter,\\nshortening, lard, or coconut oil. However, some foods, such as desserts and sweet snacks, that are prepared with\\noils instead of fats high in saturated fat are still high in added sugars, and are thus not a nutrient-dense food choice.\\n\\nBeverages\\n\\nWhen choosing beverages in a healthy dietary pattern, both the calories and nutrients that they provide are important\\nconsiderations. Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as\\nfat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Coffee, tea, and flavored\\nwaters also are options, but the most nutrient-dense options for these beverages include little, if any, sweeteners or\\ncream. For discussion on sugar-sweetened beverages or alcohol, see “Added Sugars” and “Alcoholic Beverages,”\\nrespectively.\\nCAFFEINE\\nCaffeine is a dietary component that functions in the body as a stimulant. Most intake of caffeine in the United\\nStates comes from coffee, tea, and soda. Caffeine is a substance that is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in\\ncola-type beverages by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For healthy adults, the FDA has cited 400 milligrams\\nper day of caffeine as an amount not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects. Additional information\\nrelated to caffeine is provided in subsequent life stage chapters.\\n\\nPage 35 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n3\\n\\nBeverages and Added Sugars\\n\\nExamples of beverages that often have added\\nsugars are regular soda (i.e., not sugar-free), fruit\\ndrinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened\\nwaters, and coffee and tea beverages with added\\nsugars. Coffee and tea beverages from restaurants\\ncan contain many extra calories because of the\\naddition of cream or milk and sugar.

Calcium, potassium, dietary fiber, and\\nvitamin D are considered dietary components of\\npublic health concern for the general U.S. population\\nbecause low intakes are associated with health\\nconcerns. Additional dietary components that are\\nunderconsumed during specific life stages are\\nhighlighted in subsequent chapters.\\nIf a healthy dietary pattern is consumed, amounts\\nof calcium, potassium, and dietary fiber can meet\\nrecommendations. Individuals should be encouraged\\nto make shifts to increase the intake of vegetables,\\nfruits, beans, whole grains, and dairy to move intakes\\nof these underconsumed dietary components closer to\\nrecommendations. In some cases, fortified foods and\\ndietary supplements may be useful in providing one\\nor more nutrients that otherwise may be consumed\\nin less than recommended amounts. Vitamin D\\nrecommendations are harder to achieve through\\nnatural sources from diet alone and would require\\nconsuming foods and beverages fortified with vitamin\\nD. In many cases, taking a vitamin D supplement may\\nbe appropriate especially when sunlight exposure is\\nlimited due to climate or the use of sunscreen.

Additionally, a healthy dietary pattern is designed to not exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake Level\\n(UL) or Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) level for nutrients. To achieve these goals, the pattern is based on\\nconsuming foods and beverages in their nutrient-dense forms—forms with the least amounts of added sugars,\\nsaturated fat, and sodium.\\nMost of the calories a person needs to eat each day—around 85 percent—are needed to meet food group\\nrecommendations healthfully, in nutrient-dense forms. The remaining calories—around 15 percent—are calories\\navailable for other uses, including for added sugars or saturated fat beyond the small amounts found in nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages within the pattern, to consume more than the recommended amount of a food\\ngroup, or for alcoholic beverages. This equates to 250 to 350 remaining calories for calorie patterns appropriate for\\nmost Americans.\\n\\nFigure 1-7\\n\\nThe 85-15 Guide: Percentage of Calories Needed To Meet Food\\nGroup Needs With Nutrient-Dense Choices and Percentage\\nLeft for Other Uses\\nTotal Calories Per Day\\n\\n85%\\n\\nof calories are needed per day to meet\\nfood group recommendations healthfully,\\nin nutrient-dense forms\\n\\n15%\\n\\nof remaining\\ncalories are available\\nfor other uses\\n(including added\\nsugars and\\nsaturated fat)\\n\\nPage 37 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\nFigure 1-8\\n\\nMaking Nutrient-Dense Choices:\\nOne Meal At a Time\\nSlight changes to individual parts of a meal can make a big difference.

For\\nexample, one way to use remaining calories is to add\\nsmall amounts of added sugars or saturated fat to\\nsome nutrient-dense foods to help make some foods\\nmore palatable while working towards meeting food\\ngroup recommendations—for example, oatmeal with a\\nsmall amount of brown sugar or vegetables prepared\\nwith small amounts of butter. However, to achieve a\\nhealthy dietary pattern, all (or mostly all) food group\\nrecommendations should be met with foods and\\nbeverages that are in nutrient-dense forms.\\nA healthy dietary pattern has little room available for\\nfoods and beverages high in added sugars, saturated\\nfat, and/or sodium. Intakes of foods and beverages\\nhigh in these components should be limited. These\\nfoods and beverages should be occasional choices—\\nconsumed in small portions.\\nWhile intakes of added sugars, saturated fat, and\\nsodium should be limited, the guidance below is\\nintended to allow programs and individuals to have\\nsome flexibility to choose a healthy dietary pattern\\nwithin calorie limits that fits personal preferences and\\ncultural traditions—and allows day-to-day flexibility\\n\\nto support a healthy dietary pattern over\\ntime. Additionally, if alcoholic beverages\\nare consumed, intakes should be within the\\nlimits described in this chapter, and calories should\\nbe accounted for to keep total calorie intake at an\\nappropriate level.\\n\\nAdded Sugars\\n\\nA healthy dietary pattern limits added sugars to less\\nthan 10 percent of calories per day. Added sugars\\ncan help with preservation; contribute to functional\\nattributes such as viscosity, texture, body, color, and\\nbrowning capability, and/or help improve the palatability\\nof some nutrient-dense foods. In fact, the nutrientdense choices included in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary\\nPattern are based on availability in the U.S. food supply\\nand include 17-50 calories from added sugars, or\\n1.5-2 percent of total calories.\\nFoods and beverages high in calories from added sugars\\nshould be limited to help achieve healthy dietary patterns\\nwithin calorie limits. When added sugars in foods and\\nbeverages exceed 10 percent of calories, a healthy\\ndietary pattern within calories limits is very difficult to\\nachieve. Most Americans have less than 8 percent of\\ncalories available for added sugars, including the added\\nsugars inherent to a healthy dietary pattern. The limit for\\nadded sugars is based on the following assumptions:\\n\\nPage 41 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\n• Most calorie levels have less than 15 percent\\nof calories remaining after meeting food group\\nrecommendations through nutrient-dense choices.\\n\\nless than the allotted amount of calories for saturated\\nfat, 10 percent of added sugars may fit in a healthy\\ndietary pattern.\\n\\n• Approximately half of remaining calories are\\nconsumed as saturated fat and half consumed as\\nadded sugars.\\n\\nAdded sugars account on average for almost 270\\ncalories—or more than 13 percent of total calories—per\\nday in the U.S. population. As shown in Figure 1-10,\\nthe major sources of added sugars in typical U.S. diets\\nare sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts and sweet\\nsnacks, sweetened coffee and tea, and candy. Together,\\nthese food categories make up more than half of the\\nintake of all added sugars while contributing very little\\nto food group recommendations.\\n\\n• Total saturated fat intakes meet the recommendation\\nfor less than 10 percent of total calorie intake.\\n• No alcoholic beverages are consumed.\\n• Overall calorie intake does not exceed intake needs to\\nmaintain or achieve a healthy weight.\\nBased on the assumptions above, an individual who\\nneeds 2,000 calories per day (based on age, sex,\\nand physical activity level) has less than 7 percent\\nof calories available for added sugars. Individuals\\nwho need 2,800 calories per day or less have less\\nthan 8 percent of calories available for added sugars.\\nIndividuals who need more than 3,000 calories may\\nhave a total of 9 to 10 percent of calories available for\\nadded sugars. In this portion of the population that\\nrequires high calorie intake, an upper limit of 10 percent\\nof calories from added sugars may be consumed while\\nstill meeting food group recommendations in nutrientdense forms. The 10 percent added sugar limit allows\\nfor flexibility in food choices over time but also requires\\ncareful planning. For example, if one chooses to eat\\n\\nIndividuals have many potential options for reducing the\\nintake of added sugars, including reducing the intake\\nof major sources of added sugars. Strategies include\\nreducing portions, consuming these items less often,\\nand selecting options low in added sugars. For those\\nwith a weight loss goal, limiting intake of foods and\\nbeverages high in added sugars is a strategy to help\\nreduce calorie intake.\\nIt should be noted that replacing added sugars with\\nlow- and no-calorie sweeteners may reduce calorie\\nintake in the short-term and aid in weight management,\\nyet questions remain about their effectiveness as a\\nlong-term weight management strategy. For additional\\ninformation about high-intensity sweeteners permitted\\nfor use in food in the United States, see fda.gov/food/\\nfood-additives-petitions/high-intensity-sweeteners.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 42\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\nFigure 1-10\\n\\nTop Sources and Average Intakes of Added\\nSugars: U.S. Population Ages 1 and Older\\nBreakfast\\nCereals & Bars\\n\\nCandy &\\nSugars\\n\\n7\\n\\n%\\n\\nAdded Sugars\\nAverage Intake:\\n266 kcal/day\\n\\n4\\n\\n9%\\n\\nSugar-Sweetened\\nBeverages\\n\\n24%\\n\\nHigher Fat\\nMilk & Yogurt\\n\\n%\\n\\nDesserts &\\nSweet Snacks\\n\\n19%\\n\\nOther Sources\\n\\n19%\\n\\nCoffee & Tea\\nSandwiches\\n\\n7\\n\\n%\\n\\n11%\\n\\nWithin Sugar-Sweetened\\nBeverages:\\nOther Sources\\n\\n1%\\n\\nWithin Desserts &\\nSweet Snacks:\\nOther Sources\\n\\n1%\\n\\nSoft Drinks\\n\\n16\\n\\n%\\n\\nIceCream\\nCream&&\\nIce\\nFrozen\\nDairy\\nFrozen\\nDesserts\\nDairy Desserts\\n\\n%%\\n\\n%\\n\\n2\\n\\n%\\n\\n6\\n\\n5\\n\\n%\\n\\n3\\nCookies &\\n&\\nCookies\\nBrownies\\nBrownies\\n\\nFruit Drinks\\n\\nDoughnuts,\\nSweet Rolls,\\n& Pastries\\n\\nS\\n\\n55\\n\\n%%\\n\\nCakes &\\n& Pies\\nPies\\nCakes\\nSport &\\nEnergy Drinks\\n\\n4\\n\\n%%\\n\\nData Source: Analysis of What We Eat in America, NHANES, 2013-2016, ages 1 and older, 2 days dietary intake data, weighted.\\nPage 43 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\nSaturated Fat\\n\\nFor those 2 years and older, intake of saturated fat\\nshould be limited to less than 10 percent of calories per\\nday by replacing them with unsaturated fats, particularly\\npolyunsaturated fats. Although some saturated fat is\\ninherent in foods (e.g., high-fat meat), some sources are\\nadded (e.g., butter on toast). Similar to added sugars,\\nsome of the nutrient-dense choices included in the\\nHealthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern include saturated fat.\\nApproximately 5 percent of total calories inherent to the\\nnutrient-dense foods in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary\\nPattern are from saturated fat from sources such as\\nlean meat, poultry, and eggs; nuts and seeds; grains;\\nand saturated fatty acids in oils. As such, there is little\\nroom to include additional saturated fat in a healthy\\ndietary pattern while staying within limits for saturated\\nfat and total calories.\\nCurrent average intakes of saturated fat are 11 percent\\nof calories. Only 23 percent of individuals consume\\namounts of saturated fat consistent with the limit of\\nless than 10 percent of calories. The main sources\\nof saturated fat in the U.S. diet include sandwiches,\\nincluding burgers, tacos, and burritos; desserts and\\nsweet snacks; and rice, pasta, and other grain-based\\nmixed dishes (Figure 1-11). Saturated fat is commonly\\nfound in higher amounts in high-fat meat, full-fat dairy\\nproducts (e.g., whole milk, ice cream, cheese), butter,\\ncoconut oil, and palm kernel and palm oil.\\n\\nStrategies to lower saturated fat intake include reducing\\nintakes of dessert and sweet snacks by consuming\\nsmaller portion sizes and eating these foods less often.\\nAdditional strategies include reading food labels to\\nchoose packaged foods lower in saturated fats and\\nchoosing lower fat forms of foods and beverages\\n(e.g., fat-free or low-fat milk instead of 2 percent or\\nwhole milk; lean rather than fatty cuts of meat). When\\ncooking and purchasing meals, select lean meat and\\nlower fat cheese in place of high-fat meats and regular\\ncheese—or replace them with ingredients with oils,\\nsuch as nuts, seeds, or avocado. Cook and purchase\\nproducts made with oils higher in polyunsaturated and\\nmonounsaturated fat (e.g., canola, corn, olive, peanut,\\nsafflower, soybean, and sunflower) rather than butter,\\nshortening, or coconut or palm oils.\\nA note on trans fats and dietary cholesterol: The\\nNational Academies recommends that trans fat\\nand dietary cholesterol consumption to be as low\\nas possible without compromising the nutritional\\nadequacy of the diet. The USDA Dietary Patterns are\\nlimited in trans fats and low in dietary cholesterol.\\nCholesterol and a small amount of trans fat occur\\nnaturally in some animal source foods. As of June\\n2018, partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the major\\nsource of artificial trans fat in the food supply, are no\\nlonger Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). Therefore,\\nPHOs are no longer added to foods.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 44\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\nFigure 1-11\\n\\nTop Sources and Average Intakes of\\nSaturated Fat: U.S. Population Ages 1 and Older\\nEggs\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\nPizza\\n\\n5\\n\\n%\\n\\nPoultry,\\nExcluding Deli &\\nMixed Dishes\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n4\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\nSaturated Fat\\nAverage Intake:\\n239 calories/day\\n\\nMeat, Poultry &\\nSeafood Mixed\\nDishes\\n\\nHigher Fat\\nMilk & Yogurt\\n\\n%\\n\\nSpreads\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\nSandwiches\\n\\nDesserts &\\nSweet Snacks\\n\\n19%\\n\\n11%\\n\\nMeats,\\nExcluding Deli\\n& Mixed Dishes\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\nRice, Pasta & Other\\nGrain-Based\\nMixed Dishes\\n\\nCheese\\n\\n4\\n\\nVegetables,\\nExcluding\\nStarchy\\n\\n%\\n\\n4\\n\\n7\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\nChips, Crackers\\n& Savory\\nSnacks\\n\\n4\\n\\n%\\nOther Sources\\n\\n20%\\n\\nStarchy\\nVegetables\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\nBreakfast\\nSandwiches\\n\\nWithin\\nSandwiches:\\n\\nOther\\nSandwiches\\n\\n%\\n\\nBurritos &\\nTacos\\n\\n6\\n4\\n1 3\\n\\n%\\n\\nBurgers\\n\\nHotdog\\nSandwiches\\n\\n2\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\nCakes & Pies\\n\\nChicken & Turkey\\nSandwiches\\n\\n2 3\\n%\\n\\nWithin Desserts &\\nSweet Snacks:\\n\\n%\\n\\nIce Cream &\\nFrozen Dairy\\nDesserts\\n\\n4\\n\\nCookies &\\nBrownies\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\n2\\n\\n%\\n\\nDoughnuts,\\nSweet Rolls\\n& Pastries\\n\\nData Source: Analysis of What We Eat in America, NHANES, 2013-2016, ages 1 and older, 2 days dietary intake data, weighted.\\nPage 45 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\nSodium\\n\\nSodium is an essential nutrient primarily consumed as\\nsalt (sodium chloride). Healthy eating patterns\\nlimit sodium to the Chronic Disease Risk Reduction\\n(CDRR) levels defined by the National Academies—\\n1,200 mg/day for ages 1 through 3; 1,500 mg/day for\\nages 4 through 8; 1,800 mg/day for ages 9 through 13;\\nand 2,300 mg/day for all other age groups. The CDRR for\\nsodium was established using evidence of the benefit of\\nreducing sodium intake on cardiovascular risk and\\nhypertension risk.\\nAs a food ingredient, sodium is used in multiple ways,\\nincluding curing meat, baking, as a thickening agent, as a\\nflavor enhancer, as a preservative, and to retain moisture.\\nThe nutrient-dense choices in the Healthy U.S.-Style\\nDietary Pattern provide approximately 60-100 percent of\\nthe age-specific CDRR for sodium across calorie levels\\nwith amounts ranging from about 1,000 to 2,200 mg.\\nFor most calorie levels and at most ages, there is very\\nlittle room for food choices that are high in sodium.\\nAverage intakes of sodium are high across the U.S.\\npopulation compared to the CDRRs. Average intakes\\nfor those ages 1 and older is 3,393 milligrams per day,\\nwith a range of about 2,000 to 5,000 mg per day. Only a\\nsmall proportion of total sodium intake is from sodium\\ninherent in foods or from salt added in home cooking\\nor at the table. Most sodium consumed in the United\\nStates comes from salt added during commercial food\\nprocessing and preparation, including foods prepared\\nat restaurants.\\nSodium is found in foods from almost all food categories\\nacross the food supply (Figure 1-12), including mixed\\ndishes such as sandwiches, burgers, and tacos; rice,\\npasta, and grain dishes; pizza; meat, poultry, and\\nseafood dishes; and soups. Calorie intake is highly\\nassociated with sodium intake (i.e., the more foods and\\nbeverages people consume, the more sodium they tend\\nto consume).\\nBecause sodium is found in so many foods, multiple\\nstrategies should be implemented to reduce sodium\\nintake to the recommended limits. Careful choices are\\nneeded in all food groups to reduce intake. Strategies\\nto lower sodium intake include cooking at home more\\noften; using the Nutrition Facts label to choose products\\nwith less sodium, reduced sodium, or no-salt-added, etc.;\\nand flavoring foods with herbs and spices instead of salt\\nbased on personal and cultural foodways.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 46\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\nFigure 1-12\\n\\nTop Sources and Average Intakes of Sodium:\\nU.S. Population Ages 1 and Older\\nYeast Breads\\n& Tortillas\\n\\nStarchy\\nVegetables\\n\\nPoultry,\\nExcluding Deli &\\nMixed Dishes\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\nChips, Crackers\\n& Savory Snacks\\n\\nPizza\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n%\\n\\nEggs\\n\\n3\\n\\nSodium\\nAverage Intake:\\n3,393 mg/day\\n\\nDeli & Cured\\nProducts\\n\\n%\\n\\nSandwiches\\n\\n%\\n\\n21%\\n\\n4\\n\\n7%\\n\\nMeat, Poultry\\n& Seafood\\nMixed Dishes\\n\\n%\\n\\n5\\n\\n%\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\n8%\\n\\nVegetables,\\nExcluding Starchy\\n\\nSoups\\n\\nBreakfast\\nCereals & Bars\\n\\nRice, Pasta &\\nOther Grain-Based\\nMixed Dishes\\n\\nDesserts &\\nSweet Snacks\\n\\n4\\n\\n%\\nOther Sources\\n\\n19%\\n\\nCondiments\\n& Gravies\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\nWithin\\nSandwiches:\\nHotdog\\nSandwiches\\n\\n2 2\\n\\nWithin Rice, Pasta &\\nOther Grain-Based\\nMixed Dishes:\\n\\nBreakfast\\nSandwiches\\n\\n%\\n\\nOther Sources\\n\\n%\\n\\nOther\\nSandwiches\\n\\n7\\n\\n4\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\n1 3\\n%\\n\\nPBJ\\nSandwiches\\n\\nChicken & Turkey\\nSandwiches\\n\\n%\\n\\nBurritos &\\nTacos\\n\\n3%\\n\\n3 1\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\nOther Sources\\n\\n2\\n\\nOther\\nMexican Dishes,\\nExcludes\\nTacos & Burritos\\n\\n1\\n\\n%\\n\\n%\\n\\nRice Mixed\\nDishes\\n\\nPasta Mixed Dishes,\\nExcludes\\nMacaroni & Cheese\\n\\nData Source: Analysis of What We Eat in America, NHANES, 2013-2016, ages 1 and older, 2 days dietary intake data, weighted.\\nPage 47 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\n4\\n\\nNutrition Facts Label\\n\\nThe Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods and beverages is a tool for making informed and healthy\\nfood choices.

There are also some people who should not drink\\nat all, such as if they are pregnant or might be pregnant;\\nunder the legal age for drinking; if they have certain\\nmedical conditions or are taking certain medications that\\ncan interact with alcohol; and if they are recovering from\\nan alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control\\nthe amount they drink. If adults age 21 years and older\\nchoose to drink alcoholic beverages, drinking less is\\nbetter for health than drinking more.\\nEvidence indicates that, among those who drink, higher\\naverage alcohol consumption is associated with an\\nincreased risk of death from all causes compared with\\nlower average alcohol consumption. Alcohol misuse\\nor consuming alcohol in excess of recommendations\\nincreases risk of several other conditions such as liver\\ndisease, cardiovascular disease, injuries, and alcohol\\nuse disorders.\\nFor the purposes of evaluating amounts of alcohol that\\nmay be consumed, the Dietary Guidelines defines drink\\nequivalents. One alcoholic drink equivalent is defined as\\ncontaining 14 grams (0.6 fl oz) of pure alcohol.\\nThe following count as one alcoholic drink equivalent:\\n12 fluid ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol), 5 fluid\\nounces of wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 fluid ounces of\\n80 proof distilled spirits (40% alcohol). To help Americans\\nmove toward a healthy dietary pattern and minimize\\nrisks associated with drinking, adults of legal drinking\\nage can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation\\nby limiting intakes to 2 drinks or less in a day for men\\nand 1 drink or less in a day for women, on days when\\nalcohol is consumed. This is not intended as an average\\nover several days, but rather the amount consumed on\\nany single day. Binge drinking,3 defined as 5 or more\\ndrinks for the typical adult male or 4 or more drinks for\\n3 More\\n\\n4\\n\\nthe typical adult female in about 2 hours, should\\nbe avoided. Emerging evidence suggests that\\neven drinking within the recommended limits\\nmay increase the overall risk of death from various\\ncauses, such as from several types of cancer and some\\nforms of cardiovascular disease. Alcohol has been\\nfound to increase risk for cancer, and for some types of\\ncancer, the risk increases even at low levels of alcohol\\nconsumption (less than 1 drink in a day). Caution,\\ntherefore, is recommended.\\nAlcoholic beverages are not a component of the\\nUSDA Dietary Patterns. The amount of alcohol and\\ncalories in beverages varies and should be accounted\\nfor within the limits of healthy dietary patterns, so\\nthat calorie limits are not exceeded (see “Calories in\\nAlcoholic Beverages”).\\n\\nApproximately 60 percent of adults report alcoholic\\nbeverage consumption in the past month. Of those,\\napproximately 30 percent binge drink, sometimes\\nmultiple times per month. During days when men and\\nwomen consume alcohol, their consumption typically\\nexceeds current guidance. Among adults, including\\nthose who do not drink, alcoholic beverages contribute\\napproximately 5 percent of calorie intake (3 to 4% of\\ncalories for women and 5 to 7% for men); this translates\\ninto approximately 9 percent of calories among those\\nwho drink. As such, among those who drink, alcoholic\\nbeverages, alone, account for most of the calories that\\nremain after meeting food group recommendations\\nin nutrient-dense forms—leaving very few calories for\\nadded sugars or saturated fat.\\nAdults who choose to drink, and are not among the\\nindividuals listed above who should not drink, are\\nencouraged to limit daily intakes to align with the Dietary\\nGuidelines—and to consider calories from alcoholic\\nbeverages so as not to exceed daily calorie limits.\\n\\ninformation is available at niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking.\\n\\nCalories in Alcoholic Beverages\\n\\nAlcoholic beverages supply calories but few nutrients,\\nand calories from alcoholic beverages should be\\naccounted for to keep total calorie intake at an\\nappropriate level. Alcoholic beverages may contain\\ncalories from both alcohol and other ingredients, such\\nas soda, juice, and added sugars. It is important to\\nconsider ingredients and portion size. The range of\\ncalories in cocktails varies widely depending on serving\\nsize and ingredients. Examples of calories contained in\\nalcoholic beverages include:\\n\\n12 fluid ounces of regular\\nbeer (5% alcohol):\\nabout 150 calories\\n\\n5 fluid ounces of wine\\n(12% alcohol):\\nabout 120 calories\\n\\n1.5 fluid ounces of\\n80 proof distilled spirits\\n(40% alcohol): about 100 calories\\n\\n7 fluid ounces of a\\nrum (40% alcohol) and\\ncola: about 190 calories\\n\\nMore information on calories in alcoholic beverages is\\navailable at rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/Tools/\\nCalculators/calorie-calculator.aspx.\\n\\nPage 49 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan\\n\\n\\x0cGuideline\\n\\nSupport Healthy\\nDietary Patterns for\\nAll Americans\\nEveryone has a role to play to support access to healthy\\nfoods and beverages in multiple settings nationwide\\nwhere people live, learn, work, play, and gather.

Food reformulation and\\nmenu and retail modification opportunities include\\noffering more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat\\nand fat-free dairy, and a greater variety of protein foods\\nthat are nutrient dense, while also reducing sodium\\nand added sugars, reducing saturated fat and replacing\\nit with unsaturated fats, and reducing added refined\\nstarches. Portion sizes also can be reduced to help\\nindividuals make choices that better fit within their\\ncalorie needs. Food manufacturers are encouraged to\\nconsider the entire composition of the food or beverage,\\nand not just individual nutrients or ingredients when\\ndeveloping or reformulating products.\\nSimilarly, when developing or modifying menus,\\nestablishments can consider the range of offerings\\nboth within and across food groups and other dietary\\ncomponents to determine whether the healthy options\\noffered reflect the proportions in healthy dietary\\npatterns. In taking these actions, care should be taken\\nto assess any potential unintended consequences so\\nthat as changes are made to better align with the Dietary\\nGuidelines, undesirable changes are not introduced. For\\nexample, a change made to reduce the amount of added\\nsugars in a product should not come at the expense of\\nincreasing the amount of saturated fat or sodium.\\nFood access is influenced by diverse factors, such as\\nproximity to food retail outlets (e.g., the number and\\n\\n4\\n\\ntypes of stores in an area), ability to prepare\\none’s own meals or eat independently, and the\\navailability of personal or public transportation.\\nThe underlying socioeconomic characteristics of a\\nneighborhood also may influence an individual’s ability\\nto access foods to support healthy eating patterns.\\n\\nIn 2019, 10.5 percent of households were food insecure\\nat least some time during the year. Food insecurity\\noccurs when access to nutritionally adequate and\\nsafe food is limited or uncertain. Food insecurity can\\nbe temporary or persist over time, preventing\\nindividuals and families from following a healthy\\ndietary pattern that aligns with the Dietary Guidelines.\\nThe prevalence of food insecurity typically rises during\\ntimes of economic downturn as households experience\\ngreater hardship. Government and nongovernment\\nnutrition assistance programs help alleviate food\\ninsecurity and play an essential role by providing food,\\nmeals, and educational resources so that participants\\ncan make healthy food choices within their budget.\\nChapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 highlight examples of these\\nresources at each life stage.\\nAs discussed in subsequent chapters, everyone has\\nan important role in leading disease prevention efforts\\nwithin their organizations and communities to make\\nhealthy eating an organizational and societal norm.\\nChanges at multiple levels of society are needed, and\\nthese changes, in combination and over time, can\\nhave a meaningful impact on the health of current and\\nfuture generations.\\n\\nLooking Toward\\nthe Life Stages\\nThis chapter has provided guidance about the\\nfundamentals of a healthy dietary pattern. These\\nfundamentals are remarkably consistent across life\\nstages, even though each stage also has its own\\nspecific nutrition considerations. The following chapters\\nbuild on this chapter and take a closer look at each of\\nthe life stages: Chapter 2 provides a focused discussion\\nof the unique nutritional needs of infants and toddlers.\\nChapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 present recommended dietary\\npatterns, describe current nutrition intakes, and provide\\ntailored nutrition information specific to children and\\nadolescents, adults, women who are pregnant or\\nlactating, and older adults, respectively.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 1: Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan | Page 50\\n\\n\\x0cB IRTH TH ROUGH 2 3 M O NT HS\\n\\nPage 51 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers\\n\\n\\x0cB I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS\\n\\n2\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nInfants and\\nToddlers\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers | Page 52\\n\\n\\x0cB IRTH TH ROUGH 2 3 M O NT HS\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nKey Recommendations\\n\\nT\\n\\n• For about the first 6 months\\nof life, exclusively feed infants\\nhuman milk.

It also is key for\\nestablishing healthy dietary patterns\\nthat may influence the trajectory of\\neating behaviors and health throughout\\nthe life course. During this period,\\nnutrients critical for brain development\\nand growth must be provided in\\nadequate amounts. Children in this\\nage group consume small quantities\\nof foods, so it’s important to make\\nevery bite count!\\n\\n• Provide infants with supplemental\\nvitamin D beginning soon\\nafter birth.\\n• At about 6 months, introduce\\ninfants to nutrient-dense\\ncomplementary foods.\\n• Introduce infants to potentially\\nallergenic foods along with other\\ncomplementary foods.\\n• Encourage infants and toddlers to\\nconsume a variety of foods from\\nall food groups. Include foods rich\\nin iron and zinc, particularly for\\ninfants fed human milk.\\n• Avoid foods and beverages with\\nadded sugars.\\n• Limit foods and beverages higher\\nin sodium.\\n• As infants wean from human milk\\nor infant formula, transition to a\\nhealthy dietary pattern.\\n\\nPage 53 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers\\n\\n\\x0cB I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS\\n\\nHuman milk feeding alone is the ideal form of nutrition\\nfrom birth through about age 6 months. Human milk\\nprovides necessary nutrients, protective factors against\\ndisease, and other unique immunological benefits. If\\nhuman milk is unavailable, infants should be fed an ironfortified commercial infant formula. Once an infant is\\ndevelopmentally ready, foods and beverages should be\\nintroduced to complement human milk feeding. These\\ncomplementary foods and beverages are essential to\\nmeet the nutrient requirements of infants starting at\\nabout age 6 months and should be selected carefully\\nto help meet these needs. As an infant becomes a\\ntoddler, and learns to eat a variety of foods, flavors, and\\ntextures, the goal of complementary feeding becomes\\nestablishing a healthy dietary pattern and transitioning to\\na healthy family diet by age 2.\\n\\nPutting the Key\\nRecommendations\\nInto Action\\nFeed Infants Human Milk for the First\\n6 Months, If Possible\\n\\nExclusive human milk feeding is one of the best ways to\\nstart an infant off on the path of lifelong healthy nutrition.\\nExclusive human milk feeding, commonly referred to as\\nexclusive breastfeeding, refers to an infant consuming\\nonly human milk, and not in combination with infant\\nformula and/or complementary foods or beverages\\n(including water), except for medications or vitamin and\\nmineral supplementation.\\nHuman milk can support an infant’s nutrient needs for\\nabout the first 6 months of life, with the exception of\\nvitamin D and potentially iron. In addition to nutrients,\\nhuman milk includes bioactive substances and\\n\\nimmunologic properties that support infant health and\\ngrowth and development.\\nU.S. data show that about 84 percent of infants born in\\n2017 were ever fed human milk, with only 25 percent fed\\nhuman milk exclusively through age 6 months, and 35\\npercent continuing to be fed any human milk at age 12\\nmonths. Nearly one-quarter of infants were fed some\\nhuman milk beyond age 12 months, with about 15 percent\\nof toddlers being fed human milk at age 18 months.\\nFamilies may have a number of reasons for not having\\nhuman milk for their infant. For example, a family may\\nchoose not to breastfeed, a child may be adopted, or the\\nmother may be unable to produce a full milk supply or\\nmay be unable to pump and store milk safely due to family\\nor workplace pressures. If human milk is unavailable,\\ninfants should be fed an iron-fortified commercial infant\\nformula (i.e., labeled “with iron”) regulated by the U.S.\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA), which is based on\\nstandards that ensure nutrient content and safety. Infant\\nformulas are designed to meet the nutritional needs of\\ninfants and are not needed beyond age 12 months. It is\\nimportant to take precautions to ensure that expressed\\nhuman milk and prepared infant formula are handled\\nand stored safely (see “Proper Handling and Storage of\\nHuman Milk and Infant Formula”).\\n\\nDonor Human Milk\\n\\nIf families do not have sufficient human milk for their infant but want to feed their infant human\\nmilk, they may look for alternative ways to obtain it. It is important for the family to obtain\\npasteurized donor human milk from a source, such as an accredited human milk bank, that has\\nscreened its donors and taken appropriate safety precautions. When human milk is obtained\\ndirectly from individuals or through the internet, the donor is unlikely to have been screened for\\ninfectious diseases, and it is unknown whether the human milk has been collected or stored in\\na way to reduce possible safety risks to the baby. More information is available at fda.gov/science-research/\\npediatrics/use-donor-human-milk.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers | Page 54\\n\\n\\x0cB IRTH TH ROUGH 2 3 M O NT HS\\n\\nProper Handling and Storage of Human Milk and\\nInfant Formula\\n• Wash hands thoroughly before expressing human milk or preparing to feed\\nhuman milk or infant formula.\\n• If expressing human milk, ensure pump parts are thoroughly cleaned\\nbefore use.\\n• If preparing powdered infant formula, use a safe water source and follow\\ninstructions on the label.\\n• Refrigerate freshly expressed human milk within 4 hours for up to 4 days.\\nPreviously frozen and thawed human milk should be used within 24 hours.\\nThawed human milk should never be refrozen. Refrigerate prepared infant\\nformula for up to 24 hours.\\n• Do not use a microwave to warm human milk or infant formula. Warm safely\\nby placing the sealed container of human milk or infant formula in a bowl of\\nwarm water or under warm, running tap water.\\n• Once it has been offered to the infant, use or discard leftovers quickly (within\\n2 hours for human milk or 1 hour for infant formula).\\n• Thoroughly wash all infant feeding items, such as bottles and nipples.\\nConsider sanitizing feeding items for infants younger than 3 months of age,\\ninfants born prematurely, or infants with a compromised immune system.\\nMore information on storing and handling human milk is available at cdc.gov/\\nbreastfeeding/recommendations/handling_breastmilk.htm.

Toddler milks or toddler formulas\\nshould not be fed to infants, as they are not designed to meet the\\nnutritional needs of infants.\\n\\nProvide Infants Supplemental Vitamin D Beginning\\nSoon After Birth\\n\\nAll infants who are fed human milk exclusively or who receive both\\nhuman milk and infant formula (mixed fed) will need a vitamin D\\nsupplement of 400 IU per day beginning soon after birth. Infant formula\\nis fortified with vitamin D, thus, when an infant is receiving full feeds\\nof infant formula, vitamin D supplementation is not needed. Families\\nwho do not wish to provide a supplement directly to their infant should\\ndiscuss with a healthcare provider the risks and benefits of maternal\\nhigh dose supplementation options. Even when consuming a varied\\ndiet, achieving adequate vitamin D from foods and beverages (natural\\nsources) alone is challenging, suggesting that young children may\\nneed to continue taking a vitamin D supplement after age 12 months.\\nParents, caregivers, and guardians should consult with a healthcare\\nprovider to determine how long supplementation is necessary.\\n\\nIntroduce Infants To Nutrient-Dense Complementary\\nFoods at About 6 Months Old\\n\\nSupplemental Vitamin B12\\n\\nHuman milk has sufficient vitamin\\nB12 to meet infant needs unless\\nthe mother’s vitamin B12 status\\nis inadequate. This can occur for\\ndifferent reasons, including when\\nthe mother eats a strictly vegan\\ndiet without any animal source\\nfoods. When the mother is at risk\\nof vitamin B12 deficiency, human\\nmilk may not provide sufficient\\nvitamin B12. In these cases, the\\nmother and/or infant fed human\\nmilk may require a vitamin B12\\nsupplement. Parents, caregivers,\\nand guardians should consult with\\na healthcare provider to determine\\nwhether supplementation is\\nnecessary.\\n\\nAt about age 6 months, infants should be introduced to nutrient-dense,\\ndevelopmentally appropriate foods to complement human milk or\\ninfant formula feedings. Some infants may show developmental signs\\nof readiness before age 6 months (see “Developmental Readiness for\\nBeginning to Eat Solid Foods”), but introducing complementary foods\\nbefore age 4 months is not recommended. Waiting until after age 6\\nmonths to introduce foods also is not recommended. Starting around\\nthat time, complementary foods are necessary to ensure adequate\\nnutrition and exposure to flavors, textures, and different types of foods.\\nInfants should be given age- and developmentally appropriate foods to\\nhelp prevent choking. It is important to introduce potentially allergenic\\nfoods along with other complementary foods. For infants fed human\\nmilk, it is particularly important to include complementary foods that\\nare rich in iron and zinc when starting complementary foods (see\\nAppendix 1: Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups).\\nAbout one-third (32%) of infants in the United States are introduced\\nto complementary foods and beverages before age 4 months,\\nhighlighting the importance of providing guidance and support to\\nparents, guardians, and caregivers on the timing of introduction to\\ncomplementary foods. Early introduction of complementary foods and\\nbeverages is higher among infants receiving infant formula (42%) or\\na combination of infant formula and human milk (32%) than among\\ninfants exclusively fed human milk (19%).\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers | Page 56\\n\\n\\x0cB IRTH TH ROUGH 2 3 M O NT HS\\n\\nDevelopmental Readiness for Beginning To\\nEat Solid Foods\\n\\nThe age at which infants reach different developmental\\nstages will vary. Typically between age 4 and 6 months,\\ninfants develop the gross motor, oral, and fine motor skills\\nnecessary to begin to eat complementary foods. As an\\ninfant’s oral skills develop, the thickness and texture of\\nfoods can gradually be varied. Signs that an infant is ready\\nfor complementary foods include:\\n• Being able to control head and neck.\\n• Sitting up alone or with support.\\n• Bringing objects to the mouth.\\n• Trying to grasp small objects, such as toys or food.\\n• Swallowing food rather than pushing it back out\\nonto the chin.\\nInfants and young children should be given age- and\\ndevelopmentally appropriate foods to help prevent\\nchoking. Foods such as hot dogs, candy, nuts and\\nseeds, raw carrots, grapes, popcorn, and chunks of\\npeanut butter are some of the foods that can be a choking\\nrisk for young children. Parents, guardians, and caregivers\\nare encouraged to take steps to decrease choking\\nrisks, including:\\n• Offering foods in the appropriate size, consistency, and\\nshape that will allow an infant or young child to eat and\\nswallow easily.\\n• Making sure the infant or young child is sitting up\\nin a high chair or other safe, supervised place.\\n• Ensuring an adult is supervising feeding\\nduring mealtimes.\\n• Not putting infant cereal or other solid foods in an\\ninfant’s bottle. This could increase the risk of choking\\nand will not make the infant sleep longer.\\nMore information on foods that can present choking\\nhazards is available from USDA at wicworks.fns.\\nusda.gov/resources/reducing-risk-choking-youngchildren-mealtimes.\\n\\nPage 57 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers\\n\\n\\x0cB I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS\\n\\nIntroduce Infants to Potentially Allergenic Foods\\nAlong With Other Complementary Foods\\n\\nPotentially allergenic foods (e.g., peanuts, egg, cow milk products,\\ntree nuts, wheat, crustacean shellfish, fish, and soy) should be\\nintroduced when other complementary foods are introduced to an\\ninfant’s diet. Introducing peanut-containing foods in the first year\\nreduces the risk that an infant will develop a food allergy to peanuts.\\nCow milk, as a beverage, should be introduced at age 12 months\\nor later (see “Establish a Healthy Beverage Pattern”). There is no\\nevidence that delaying introduction of allergenic foods, beyond\\nwhen other complementary foods are introduced, helps to prevent\\nfood allergy. For more information, see “For Infants at High Risk\\nof Peanut Allergy, Introduce Peanut-Containing Foods at Age\\n4 to 6 Months.”\\n\\nFor Infants at High Risk of\\nPeanut Allergy, Introduce\\nPeanut-Containing Foods\\nat Age 4 to 6 Months\\nIf an infant has severe eczema,\\negg allergy, or both (conditions\\nthat increase the risk of peanut\\nallergy), age-appropriate, peanutcontaining foods should be\\nintroduced into the diet as early\\nas age 4 to 6 months. This will\\nreduce the risk of developing\\npeanut allergy.\\n\\nCaregivers should check with\\nthe infant’s healthcare provider\\nbefore feeding the infant peanutcontaining foods. A blood test\\nor skin prick may be\\nrecommended to determine\\nwhether peanut should be\\nintroduced to the infant, and, if\\nso, the safest way to introduce it.\\nMore information is available in\\nthe Addendum Guidelines for the\\nPrevention of Peanut Allergy in the\\nUnited States at niaid.nih.gov/\\nsites/default/files/addendumpeanut-allergy-preventionguidelines.pdf.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers | Page 58\\n\\n\\x0cB IRTH TH ROUGH 2 3 M O NT HS\\n\\nEncourage Infants and Toddlers To\\nConsume a Variety of Complementary\\nFoods and Beverages To Meet Energy and\\nNutrient Needs\\n\\nParents, caregivers, and guardians are encouraged\\nto introduce foods across all the food groups—as\\ndescribed below and carrying forward the principles\\nin Chapter 1—including items that fit within a\\nfamily’s preferences, cultural traditions, and budget.\\nComplementary foods and beverages should be rich in\\nnutrients, meet calorie and nutrient requirements during\\nthis critical period of growth and development, and\\nstay within limits of dietary components such as added\\nsugars and sodium. Although the Dietary Guidelines does\\nnot provide a recommended dietary pattern for infants\\nages 6 through 11 months, infants should be on the\\npath to a healthy dietary pattern that is recommended\\nfor those ages 12 through 23 months (see Appendix 3:\\nUSDA Dietary Patterns).\\nIn the United States, some dietary components are\\nof public health concern for infants and toddlers. Iron\\nis a dietary component of public health concern for\\nunderconsumption among older infants ages 6 through\\n11 months who are fed primarily human milk and\\nconsume inadequate iron from complementary foods.\\nOlder infants who are fed primarily human milk also\\nunderconsume zinc and protein from complementary\\nfoods, and vitamin D, choline, and potassium are notably\\nunderconsumed by all older infants. During the second\\nyear of life, the dietary components of public health\\nconcern for underconsumption are vitamin D, calcium,\\ndietary fiber, and potassium and for overconsumption\\nare added sugars and sodium. Lists of dietary sources of\\n\\niron, calcium, potassium, dietary fiber, and vitamin D are\\navailable at DietaryGuidelines.gov.\\nINTRODUCE IRON-RICH FOODS TO INFANTS\\nSTARTING AT ABOUT 6 MONTHS OLD\\nIron-rich foods (e.g., meats and seafood rich in heme\\niron and iron-fortified infant cereals) are important\\ncomponents of the infant’s diet from age 6 through\\n11 months to maintain adequate iron status, which\\nsupports neurologic development and immune function.\\nInfants are typically born with body stores of iron\\nadequate for about the first 6 months of life, depending\\non gestational age, maternal iron status, and timing of\\numbilical cord clamping. By age 6 months, however,\\ninfants require an external source of iron apart from\\nhuman milk.\\nCaregivers of infants exclusively fed human milk should\\ntalk with their pediatric care provider about whether\\nthere may be a need for infants supplementation with\\niron before age 6 months. A complementary food source\\nof iron beginning at about 6 months is particularly\\nimportant for infants fed human milk because the iron\\ncontent of human milk is low and maternal iron intake\\nduring lactation does not increase its content. In the\\nUnited States, an estimated 77 percent of infants fed\\nhuman milk have inadequate iron intake during the\\nsecond half of infancy, highlighting the importance of\\nintroducing iron-rich foods starting at age 6 months.\\nInfants receiving most of their milk feeds as ironfortified infant formula are likely to need less iron from\\ncomplementary foods beginning at 6 months of age. After\\n\\nPage 59 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers\\n\\n\\x0cB I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS\\n\\nage 12 months, children have a lower iron requirement,\\nbut good food sources of iron are still needed to maintain\\nadequate iron status and prevent deficiency.\\nINTRODUCE ZINC-RICH FOODS TO INFANTS\\nSTARTING AT ABOUT 6 MONTHS OLD\\nZinc-rich complementary foods (e.g., meats, beans, zincfortified infant cereals) are important from age 6 months\\nonwards to support adequate zinc status, which supports\\ngrowth and immune function. Although the zinc content\\nof human milk is initially high and efficiently absorbed, the\\nconcentration declines over the first 6 months of lactation\\nand is not affected by maternal zinc intake. During the\\nsecond half of infancy, approximately half (54%) of U.S.\\ninfants fed human milk have inadequate zinc intake.\\nPrioritizing zinc-rich foods starting at 6 months of age to\\ncomplement human milk feedings will help infants meet\\ntheir requirement for zinc.\\nENCOURAGE A VARIETY OF FOODS FROM ALL\\nFOOD GROUPS TO INFANTS STARTING AT ABOUT\\n6 MONTHS OLD\\nTo support nutrient adequacy, foster acceptance of\\nhealthy foods, and set intakes on a path toward a healthy\\npattern, it is important to encourage foods from all food\\ngroups. Because very young children are being exposed\\nto new textures and flavors for the first time, it may take\\nup to 8 to 10 exposures for an infant to accept a new type\\nof food. Repeated offering of foods such as fruits and\\nvegetables increases the likelihood of an infant accepting\\nthem. A nutrient-dense, diverse diet from age 6 through\\n23 months of life includes a variety of food sources from\\neach food group.\\n• Protein foods, including meats, poultry, eggs,\\nseafood, nuts, seeds, and soy products, are important\\nsources of iron, zinc, protein, choline, and long\\nchain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The long-chain\\npolyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically the essential\\nomega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids supplied through\\nseafood, nuts, seeds, and oils, influence the infant’s\\nfatty acid status and are among the key nutrients\\nneeded for the rapid brain development that occurs\\nthrough the infant’s first 2 years of life. Some types of\\nfish such as salmon and trout are also natural sources\\nof vitamin D. To limit exposure to methylmercury from\\nseafood, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and\\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued joint\\nguidance regarding the types of seafood to choose.1\\n\\n• Vegetables and fruits, especially those rich in\\npotassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C, should be offered\\nto infants and toddlers age 6 through 23 months. The\\nvegetable subgroup of beans, peas, and lentils also\\nprovides a good source of protein and dietary fiber.\\n• For dairy, families can introduce yogurt and cheese,\\nincluding soy-based yogurt, before 12 months.\\nHowever, infants should not consume cow milk, as\\na beverage, or fortified soy beverage, before age 12\\nmonths as a replacement for human milk or infant\\nformula (see “Cow Milk and Fortified Soy Beverages”).\\nIn the second year of life, when calcium requirements\\nincrease, dairy products, including milk, yogurt,\\ncheese, and fortified soy beverages and soy yogurt\\nprovide a good source of calcium. Vitamin D-fortified\\nmilk and soy beverages also provide a good source of\\nvitamin D. For those younger than the age of 2, offer\\ndairy products without added sugar (see “Avoid\\nAdded Sugars”).\\n• Grains, including iron-fortified infant cereal, play an\\nimportant role in meeting nutrient needs during this\\nlife stage. Infant cereals fortified with iron include oat,\\nbarley, multigrain, and rice cereals. Rice cereal fortified\\nwith iron is a good source of nutrients for infants, but\\nrice cereal shouldn’t be the only type of cereal given\\nto infants. Offering young children whole grains more\\noften than refined grains will increase dietary fiber as\\nwell as potassium intake during the second year\\nof life and help young children establish healthy\\ndietary practices.\\n\\n1 U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

This is because the nutrient requirements for infants\\nand young children are quite high relative to their size, but the amount\\nof complementary foods they consume is small. Complementary\\nfoods need to be nutrient-dense and not contain additional calories\\nfrom added sugars. In addition, low- and no-calorie sweeteners, which\\ncan also be called high-intensity sweeteners, are not recommended\\nfor children younger than age 2. Taste preferences are being formed\\nduring this time period, and infants and young children may develop\\npreferences for overly sweet foods if introduced to very sweet foods\\nduring this timeframe. For more information on added sugars,\\nsee Chapter 1.\\nAvoid Foods Higher in Sodium\\nSodium is found in a number of foods, including some salty snacks,\\ncommercial toddler foods, and processed meats. In addition to\\nkeeping sodium intake within limits for toddlers (see Appendix 1),\\nanother reason to avoid high-sodium foods is that taste preferences\\nfor salty food may be established early in life. Choose fresh or\\nlow-sodium frozen foods, when available, and low-sodium canned\\nfoods to minimize sodium content. For more information on sodium,\\nsee Chapter 1.\\nAvoid Honey and Unpasteurized Foods and Beverages\\nInfants should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked\\nhoney. Honey can contain the Clostridium botulinum organism that\\ncould cause serious illness or death among infants. Infants and\\nyoung children also should not be given any unpasteurized foods or\\nbeverages, such as unpasteurized juices, milk, yogurt, or cheeses, as\\nthey could contain harmful bacteria.\\n\\nEstablish a Healthy Beverage Pattern\\n\\nAn important part of establishing an overall healthy dietary pattern is\\ncareful consideration of beverages. Guidance for different beverage\\ncategories is provided below.\\nWATER\\nFor healthy infants with adequate intake of human milk or infant\\nformula, supplemental water is typically not needed in the first\\n6 months. Small amounts (up to 4 to 8 ounces per day) of plain,\\nfluoridated drinking water can be given to infants with the introduction\\nof complementary foods. Plain, fluoridated drinking water intake\\ncan slowly be increased after age 1 to meet hydration and\\nfluoride needs.\\n\\nPage 61 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers\\n\\n\\x0cB I RT H T H R O U G H 23 M ONTHS\\n\\nCOW MILK AND FORTIFIED SOY BEVERAGES\\nInfants should not consume cow milk or fortified soy\\nbeverages before age 12 months to replace human milk\\nor infant formula. Cow milk does not have the correct\\namount of nutrients for infants, and its higher protein\\nand mineral content are hard for an infant’s kidneys\\nand digestive system to process. Plain cow milk (whole\\nmilk) or fortified unsweetened soy beverage can be\\noffered beginning around 12 months of age to help\\nmeet calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein needs.\\nFlavored milks for children age 12 through 23 months\\nshould be avoided because they contain added sugars.\\nPLANT-BASED MILK ALTERNATIVES\\nPlant-based milk alternatives, which are sometimes\\nreferred to as milk alternatives, include beverages made\\nfrom plants, such as soy, oat, rice, coconut, and almond.\\nThese beverages should not be used in the first year of\\nlife to replace human milk or infant formula. They may\\ncome in different flavors and some forms have added\\nsugars. Unsweetened versions of these beverages may\\nbe accommodated in small amounts in the diet during\\nthe second year of life, but most have significantly\\nless protein than cow milk and are not always fortified\\nwith calcium and vitamin D. Among plant-based milk\\nalternatives, only fortified soy beverage is currently\\nconsidered a dairy equivalent. Thus, consuming other\\nplant-based beverages does not contribute to meeting\\ndairy recommendations.\\n\\nSUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES\\n\\nBefore age 12 months, 100% fruit or vegetable juices\\nshould not be given to infants. In the second year of\\nlife, fruit juice is not necessary, and most fruit intake\\nshould come from eating whole fruit. If 100% fruit juice\\nis provided, up to 4 ounces per day can fit in a healthy\\ndietary pattern. Juices that contain added sugars should\\nbe avoided.\\n\\nSugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., regular soda, juice\\ndrinks [not 100% fruit juice], sports drinks, and flavored\\nwater with sugar) should not be given to children\\nyounger than age 2. Drinks labeled as fruit drinks or\\nfruit-flavored drinks are not the same as 100% fruit juice\\nand contain added sugars. These beverages displace\\nnutrient-dense beverages and foods in the diet of young\\nchildren. Infants and toddlers do not have room in their\\ndiets for the additional calories from added sugars\\nfound in these beverages. In addition, sugar-sweetened\\nbeverage intake in infancy and early childhood may\\npredispose children to consume more of these\\nbeverages later in life.\\n\\nTODDLER MILK AND TODDLER DRINKS\\n\\nCAFFEINATED BEVERAGES\\n\\nThere are no clear needs for toddler milks or drinks.\\nNeeded nutrients can be obtained from cow milk\\nor fortified soy beverage and appropriate solid\\nfoods. Toddler milks and toddler drinks are drinks\\nsupplemented with nutrients, and typically contain added\\nsugars. A variety of nutrient-dense complementary\\nfoods and beverages without added sugars should be\\nemphasized for achieving nutrient recommendations.\\n\\nConcerns exist about potential negative health effects of\\ncaffeine for young children, and no safe limits of caffeine\\nhave been established for this age group. Caffeine\\nis a stimulant that can occur naturally in foods and\\nbeverages or as an additive.

The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern\\npresented here is intended for toddlers ages 12 through\\n23 months who no longer consume human milk or\\ninfant formula. The pattern represents the types and\\namounts of foods needed to meet energy and nutrition\\nrequirements for this period (Table 2-1). For toddlers who\\nare still consuming human milk (approximately one-third\\nat 12 months and 15 percent at 18 months), a healthy\\ndietary pattern should include a similar combination of\\nnutrient-dense complementary foods and beverages.\\nTable 2-1 displays the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary\\nPattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits\\nfor food groups and other dietary components that\\nmake up healthy dietary patterns. The pattern is\\nprovided at calorie levels ranging from 700 to 1,000\\ncalories per day, which are appropriate for most\\ntoddlers ages 12 through 23 months (see Appendix 2.\\nEstimated Calorie Needs). A healthy dietary\\n\\npattern includes a variety of nutrient-dense fruits,\\nvegetables, grains, protein foods (including lean\\nmeats, poultry, eggs, seafood, nuts, and seeds), dairy\\n(including milk, yogurt, and cheese), and oils. Based on\\nFDA and EPA’s joint “Advice About Eating Fish,” young\\nchildren should eat seafood lowest in methylmercury,\\nand certain species of seafood should be avoided.2 If\\nyoung children are lower in body weight, they should eat\\nless seafood than the amounts in the Healthy U.S.-Style\\nDietary Pattern. More information is available on the FDA\\nor EPA websites at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/\\nfishadvice.\\nAfter food group and subgroup recommendations are\\nmet, a small number of calories are allocated to oils.\\nThe recommendation to limit saturated fat to less than\\n10 percent of calories per day does not apply to those\\nyounger than age 2, and the inclusion of higher fat\\nversions of dairy is a notable difference in the pattern\\nfor toddlers ages 12 through 23 months compared\\nto patterns for ages 2 and older. However, no calories\\nremain in the pattern for additional saturated fat or\\nfor added sugars. To illustrate the concept of nutrient\\ndensity, Figure 2-1 shows examples of foods and\\nbeverages appropriate for this life stage in forms\\nthat are not in nutrient-dense forms compared to those\\nthat are in nutrient-dense forms. This dietary pattern\\nrequires careful choices of foods and beverages but\\ndoes not require inclusion of fortified products\\nspecifically formulated for infants or toddlers to meet\\nnutrient recommendations.\\n\\nFigure 2-1\\nMake Healthy Shifts To Empower Toddlers To Eat Nutrient-Dense Foods in Dietary Patterns\\nScience shows that early food preferences influence later food choices. Make the first choice the healthiest choices\\nthat set the toddlers on a path of making nutrient-dense choices in the years to come. Examples of shifts in common\\nchoices to healthier, more nutrient-dense food choices include:\\n\\nCereal with Added\\nSugars\\n\\nCereal with Minimal\\nAdded Sugars\\n\\nFruit Products with\\nAdded Sugars\\n\\nFruit (e.g., canned in\\n100% juice)\\n\\nFried Vegetables\\n\\nRoasted Vegetables\\n\\nHigh-sodium Snacks\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nHigh-sodium Meats\\n\\nGround Lean Meats\\n\\nBeverages with Added\\nSugars\\n\\nUnsweetened\\nBeverages\\n\\n2 If consuming up to 2 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best Choices” list in the FDA/EPA joint “Advice About\\nEating Fish,” available at FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, children should only be fed cooked varieties\\nfrom the “Best Choices” list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g., flounder), salmon, tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters, sardines,\\nsquid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting, clams, shad, and Atlantic mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood per week, many commonly\\nconsumed varieties of seafood should be avoided because they cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per week by children without the potential of exceeding safe\\nmethylmercury limits; examples that should not be consumed include: canned light tuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass.

This pattern describes\\na lacto-ovo vegetarian diet that includes regular consumption of eggs, dairy products, soy\\nproducts, and nuts or seeds, in addition to vegetables including beans, peas, and lentils, fruits,\\ngrains, and oils. Iron may be of particular concern because plant source foods contain only\\nnon-heme iron, which is less bioavailable than is heme iron. Food source lists for both heme and non-heme\\niron are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Vitamin B12 also may be of concern because it is present only in\\nanimal source foods. When feeding infants and toddlers a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, parents, caregivers, and\\nguardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation of iron, vitamin\\nB12, and/or other nutrients is necessary and if so, appropriate levels to meet their unique needs.\\n\\nSupporting Healthy Eating\\nParents, guardians, and caregivers play an important role in nutrition during this life stage because infants and\\ntoddlers are fully reliant on them for their needs. In addition to “what” to feed children, “how” to feed young children\\nalso is critical. As noted above, repeated exposure to foods can increase acceptance of new foods. Another\\nimportant concept is responsive feeding, a feeding style that emphasizes recognizing and responding to the hunger\\nor fullness cues of an infant or young child (see “Responsive Feeding”).\\n\\nResponsive Feeding\\n\\nResponsive feeding is a term\\nused to describe a feeding style\\nthat emphasizes recognizing\\nand responding to the hunger or\\nfullness cues of an infant or young\\nchild. Responsive feeding helps\\nyoung children learn how to selfregulate their intake.\\nSee Table 2-2 for some examples\\nof signs a child may show for\\nhunger and fullness when he or\\nshe is a newborn through age 5\\nmonths, and signs a child may\\nstart to show between age 6\\nthrough 23 months.\\n\\nTable 2-2\\nSigns a Child is Hungry or Full\\nBirth Through Age 5 Months\\nA child may be hungry if he or she:\\n• Puts hands to mouth.\\n• Turns head toward breast or bottle.\\n• Puckers, smacks, or licks lips.\\n• Has clenched hands.\\n\\nA child may be full if he or she:\\n• Closes mouth.\\n• Turns head away from breast or bottle.\\n• Relaxes hands.\\n\\nAge 6 Through 23 Months\\nA child may be hungry if he or she:\\n• Reaches for or points to food.\\n• \\x07Opens his or her mouth when offered a\\nspoon or food.\\n• Gets excited when he or she sees food.\\n• \\x07Uses hand motions or makes sounds to\\nlet you know he or she is still hungry.\\n\\nA child may be full if he or she:\\n• Pushes food away.\\n• \\x07Closes his or her mouth when food is\\noffered.\\n• Turns his or her head away from food.\\n• \\x07Uses hand motions or makes sounds to\\nlet you know he or she is still full.\\n\\nIt is important to listen to the\\nchild’s hunger and fullness cues\\nto build healthy eating habits during this critical age. If parents, guardians, or caregivers have questions or concerns, a\\nconversation with a healthcare provider will be helpful.\\nFor more information on signs a child is hungry or full, see: cdc.gov/nutritioninfantandtoddlernutrition/mealtime/\\nsigns-your-child-is-hungry-or-full.html.

These include the following Government programs\\nthat aim to support a healthy dietary pattern for infants and toddlers living in\\nhouseholds with limited incomes:\\n• The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and\\nChildren (WIC) supports infant and early childhood nutrition through\\nsupplementing the diets of women who are pregnant or lactating and by\\nproviding breastfeeding support and iron-fortified infant formula when\\nhuman milk is unavailable or fed only partially. WIC accommodates\\nthe transition to solid foods by providing nutrient-dense foods in the\\nsupplemental food packages offered to older infants and toddlers. Nutrition\\neducation and counseling and referrals to healthcare and social services are\\nother important resources offered to income-eligible WIC participants.\\n• The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides reimbursement\\nfor nutrient-dense meals and snacks served to infants and toddlers in\\nparticipating child care centers, including at Head Start programs, and day\\ncare homes where infants and toddlers also have access to health\\nscreenings and families can be connected to health services to support their\\noverall well-being.\\n• The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest\\nfood assistance program in the United States. SNAP helps meet the\\nnutritional needs of infants and toddlers living in low-income households by\\nproviding temporary monthly benefits that can be used to access a healthy\\ndietary pattern.\\nThese Government nutrition programs are especially important for the\\n14 percent3 of families with children who experience food insecurity and may\\nstruggle to access the foods needed to support a healthy dietary pattern.\\nProfessionals can use these, and additional Government and non-Government\\nresources that exist within communities, to support healthy eating during\\ninfancy and toddlerhood.\\n\\nLooking Toward Chapter 3:\\nChildren and Adolescents\\nThis chapter focused on nutrition issues important to infants and toddlers—\\nexclusive human milk feeding, if possible; introducing nutrient-dense\\ncomplementary foods at about age 6 months; and encouraging infants\\nand toddlers to sample and consume a variety of nutrient-dense foods and\\nbeverages to meet their needs. As toddlers grow and their dietary patterns\\nbecome more integrated with the family’s food patterns, new issues arise.\\nThese issues, and how to accommodate them within a lifelong healthy\\ndietary pattern, are discussed in the next chapter, which focuses on children\\nand adolescents.\\n3 More information on food insecurity is available at ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-andfood-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 2: Infants and Toddlers | Page 68\\n\\n\\x0cAGES 2-18\\n\\nPage 69 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents\\n\\n\\x0cAG ES 2 -18\\n\\n3\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nChildren and\\nAdolescents\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents | Page 70\\n\\n\\x0cAGES 2-18\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nC\\n\\nhildren and adolescents include\\nindividuals ages 2 through 18—\\na life stage characterized by transitions\\nand the formation of dietary patterns.\\nSuboptimal current intake patterns among\\nchildren and adolescents and inadequate\\nphysical activity contribute to overweight\\nand obesity in this life stage and risk of\\nchronic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes,\\ncardiovascular disease) later in life.\\nChanging this trajectory is crucial because\\ndietary patterns established during this life\\nstage tend to continue into adult years.\\n\\nHealthy eating throughout this life stage involves the child or adolescent,\\nfamilies and caregivers, and institutions and settings where food is provided\\nand consumed. Young children are fully reliant on others to provide their\\nmeals and snacks. As children transition to school-age and through\\nadolescence, they are exposed to new food choices and begin to have\\nmore autonomy in the foods that are selected. New influences on eating\\nbehavior also emerge, such as peer pressure, which can create opportunities\\nor challenges for establishing dietary patterns consistent with health and\\nlongevity. Adolescents acquire ever-greater independence in their food\\nchoices as they mature, with more time spent on their own with peers\\nand more foods and beverages frequently consumed in social settings.\\nOther factors that influence eating behavior include social supports,\\nexposure to food marketing and promotion, and policies that determine\\ncommunity design.\\nYouth have diverse calorie and nutrient needs based on age and patterns\\nof growth, development, and physical activity. Current intake data of\\nyoung children show some components of a healthy dietary pattern that\\ncontinue from the infant and toddler life stages. Before these components\\nof a healthy dietary pattern are established, however, diet quality worsens\\nthrough childhood and into adolescence and intake patterns drift further\\nfrom recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines. Active community support\\nis needed to help youth meet food group and nutrient goals with nutrientdense foods and beverages.\\n\\nPage 71 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents\\n\\n\\x0cAG ES 2 -18\\n\\nChildhood Overweight and Obesity\\n\\nIn the United States, 41 percent of children and adolescents are overweight or have obesity, and the prevalence\\nis higher among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents as compared to non-Hispanic Asians\\nand Whites. Overweight and obesity put youth at high risk of serious health concerns. Youth with obesity are\\nmore likely to have immediate health risks, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and impaired glucose\\ntolerance. They also are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes beginning as soon as the\\nteenage years and into adulthood. Psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression) and social concerns (e.g., bullying,\\nstigma) also are more likely in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity.\\nThe causes of childhood obesity are complex and interconnected. Behaviors (e.g., eating habits, level of physical\\nactivity, sedentary time) and the community in which a child or adolescent resides can influence risk of obesity.\\nGenetics and the fetal environment also play a role in the development of obesity. However, many opportunities\\nexist to help prevent or manage overweight and obesity as children transition through these life stages. The goal\\nfor children and adolescents with overweight or obesity is to reduce the rate of weight gain while allowing normal\\ngrowth and development. This can primarily be done by emphasizing nutrient-dense food and beverage choices,\\nminimizing calories from sources that do not contribute to a healthy dietary pattern, and encouraging regular\\nphysical activity.\\n\\nHealthy Dietary\\nPatterns\\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to follow the\\nrecommendations on the types of foods and beverages\\nthat make up a healthy dietary pattern described in\\nChapter 1. Nutrition and Health Across the Lifespan:\\nThe Guidelines and Key Recommendations. Tables 3-1\\nto 3-3 display the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern to\\nillustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups\\nand other dietary components that make up healthy\\ndietary patterns at the calorie levels appropriate for most\\nchildren and adolescents across four age ranges: one\\ntable combining patterns relevant for ages 2 through\\n4 and ages 5 through 8, and single tables for ages 9\\nthrough 13 and for ages 14 through 18. Tables 3-1 to\\n3-3 also show the calories remaining for other uses—\\nabout 10-15 percent of the total available—after meeting\\nfood group and nutrient goals through the selection of\\nnutrient-dense foods and beverages.\\nCalorie needs generally increase throughout this life\\nstage to support growth and development. Child and\\nadolescent females generally have lower calorie needs\\n\\nthan do males, with variations based on size and level of\\nphysical activity. During adolescence, the range of calorie\\nintakes widens to support diverse growth trajectories.\\nMore information on the calorie estimates is provided in\\nTables 3-1 to 3-3 (see footnote a) and in Appendix 2.\\nEstimated Calorie Needs.\\nThe USDA Dietary Patterns, including the Healthy\\nU.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, provide a framework\\nto help children and adolescents follow a healthy\\ndietary pattern and meet the Guidelines and their\\nKey Recommendations. The USDA Foods Patterns\\ncan be customized based on dietary needs, personal\\npreferences, and budgetary constraints. A variety of\\nnutrient-dense foods and beverages can be selected\\nacross the food group and subgroups as part of an\\noverall healthy dietary pattern. For more information\\nabout the USDA Food Patterns, see Chapter 1 and\\nAppendix 3. USDA Dietary Patterns. For this age group,\\nas for all the others, a figure comparing current intakes to\\nrecommendations is presented.

With the transition to school-age (ages 5 through 8), females require\\nabout 1,200 to 1,800 calories per day and males require about 1,200 to 2,000 calories per day.\\n\\nPhysical Activity\\n\\nChildhood and adolescence is a critical period for developing movement\\nskills, learning healthy habits, and establishing a firm foundation for lifelong\\nhealth and well-being. For youth, regular physical activity can improve bone\\nhealth, cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and cognition (including\\nacademic achievement), and reduce the symptoms of depression.\\nPreschool-aged children should be active throughout the day to enhance\\ngrowth and development. Adults caring for children during this age\\nshould encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types (light,\\nmoderate, or vigorous intensity) and aim for at least 3 hours per day.\\nSchool-aged children and adolescents need at least 60 minutes of moderateto-vigorous activity daily to attain the most health benefits from physical\\nactivity.

If consuming up to 3 ounces of seafood\\nper week, children should only be fed cooked varieties from the “Best\\n\\nChoices” list that contain even lower methylmercury: flatfish (e.g.,\\nflounder), salmon, tilapia, shrimp, catfish, crab, trout, haddock, oysters,\\nsardines, squid, pollock, anchovies, crawfish, mullet, scallops, whiting,\\nclams, shad, and Atlantic mackerel. If consuming up to 3 ounces of\\nseafood per week, many commonly consumed varieties of seafood\\nshould be avoided because they cannot be consumed at 3 ounces per\\nweek by children without the potential of exceeding safe methylmercury\\nlimits; examples that should not be consumed include: canned light\\ntuna or white (albacore) tuna, cod, perch, black sea bass. For a\\ncomplete list please see: FDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.\\ne Foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or low-fat; and\\nprepared with minimal added sugars, refined starches, saturated fat,\\nor sodium. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations\\nare in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within\\nthe overall limit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The\\nnumber of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and\\nthe amounts of food from each food group required to meet nutritional\\ngoals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars\\nand/or saturated fat, or to eat more than the recommended amount of\\nfood in a food group.\\n\\nNOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines\\nlimits for added sugars and saturated fat; be within the Acceptable\\nMacronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total\\nfats; and stay within calorie limits. Values are rounded. See Appendix 3\\nfor all calorie levels of the pattern.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents | Page 74\\n\\n\\x0cAGES 2-18\\n\\nCurrent Intakes\\nFigures 3-2 to 3-9 highlight the dietary intakes of\\nchildren and adolescents, including the Healthy Eating\\nIndex-2015 score, which is an overall measure of how\\nintakes align with the Dietary Guidelines, as well as\\ninformation on the components of a healthy diet—\\nspecifically, the food groups. Figures 3-1, 3-3, 3-5,\\nand 3-7 display the average intakes of the food groups\\ncompared to the range of recommended intakes at the\\ncalorie levels most relevant to males and females in\\nthese age groups. Additionally, the percent of children\\nand adolescents exceeding the recommended limits\\nfor added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium are shown,\\nalong with average intakes of these components.\\nAverage intakes compared to recommended intake\\nranges of the subgroups for grains are represented in\\ndaily amounts; subgroups for vegetables and protein\\nfoods are represented in weekly amounts (see Figures\\n3-2, 3-4, 3-6, and 3-8).\\nCurrent intakes show that from an early age, dietary\\npatterns are not aligned with the Dietary Guidelines.\\nThe Healthy Eating Index score of 61 out of 100 for\\nchildren ages 2 through 4 indicates that overall diet\\n\\nquality is poor. Notably, HEI Scores decline throughout\\nchildhood and adolescence, with scores for adolescents\\napproximately 10 points lower than those for young\\nchildren (Figure 3-1).\\nAmong children ages 2 through 4, consumption of\\ntotal fruit is generally adequate for about 60 percent\\nof children. Compared to other age groups, a higher\\npercentage of young children also have intakes of\\ntotal vegetables at or above recommended levels.\\nThe difference between recommended and actual\\nintakes of total fruit and total vegetables emerges and\\nexpands as children age. By late adolescence, average\\nfruit and vegetable consumption is about half of the\\nrecommended range of intake. Throughout youth,\\nstarchy vegetables (e.g., white potatoes, corn)—often in\\nforms that are fried or prepared with additions such as\\nbutter and salt—are more frequently consumed than the\\nred and orange; dark green; or beans, peas, and lentils\\nvegetable subgroups. For fruit, about 70 percent of\\nintake comes from whole forms—fresh, canned, frozen,\\nor dried—and 100% juice, which are often nutrient-dense\\nforms. Some fruit is consumed through sources that are\\nnot nutrient-dense; for example, fruit as part of a baked\\ndessert or juice drink.\\n\\nFigure 3-1\\n\\nHealthy Eating Index Scores Across Childhood and Adolescence\\n100\\n\\nMaximum Total Score = 100\\n\\n80\\n\\n60\\n\\n61\\n\\n55\\n\\n52\\n\\n51\\n\\nAges 9-13\\n\\nAges 14-18\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\n0\\n\\nAges 2-4\\n\\nAges 5-8\\n\\nData Source: Analysis of What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016, ages 2 through 18, day 1 dietary intake, weighted.\\nPage 75 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents\\n\\n\\x0cAG ES 2 -18\\n\\nThe amount of dairy foods consumed by children and\\nadolescents is relatively stable across age groups.\\nBeginning at age 9 the amount of dairy foods in a\\nhealthy dietary pattern increases from 2 ½ to 3 cup\\nequivalents per day to support an increase in calcium\\nintake that is needed during these life stages. As a\\nresult, average intake of dairy foods is close to or at\\nrecommended levels for children younger than age\\n9 while consumption among adolescents is typically\\nbelow recommended intake levels.\\nAlthough the gaps between recommended and current\\nintakes widen throughout these life stages for some\\ndietary components, others, principally whole grains\\nand seafood, are infrequently consumed by any youth.\\nWhole grains are consumed below recommended levels\\neven by young children. As the difference between\\nrecommended and current intakes widens across age\\ngroups, the types of refined and whole-grain foods\\nconsumed remains consistent. Mixed dishes, such as\\npizza, pasta, sandwiches, burgers, and tacos, contribute\\nabout 50 percent of total grains intake, and snacks and\\nsweets, such as chips, crackers, and cookies, about 20\\npercent. Breakfast cereals and bars, including readyto-eat and cooked varieties, are the top contributor to\\nwhole-grains intake during these life stages. Despite\\nthe underconsumption of whole grains, intakes of\\n\\ntotal grains trend toward overconsumption due to the\\ncontribution of refined grains.\\nTotal protein intake generally meets targets except for\\nadolescent females ages 14 through 18. Youth typically\\nmeet or exceed recommendations for meats, poultry,\\nand eggs. Seafood, a protein subgroup that can support\\nintakes of beneficial fatty acids, is consumed at levels\\nfar below the lower end of the recommended intakes\\nrange. When seafood is consumed, it is typically\\nas part of a mixed dish rather than as an individual\\nfood item.\\nChildren and adolescents can improve intake patterns\\nby maintaining the components of a healthy diet that\\nare evident in early childhood, particularly total fruit\\nand dairy foods, while increasing consumption of food\\ngroups that are underconsumed across all age groups,\\nspecifically total vegetables and vegetable subgroups,\\nwhole grains, and seafood. Reducing intakes of added\\nsugars, saturated fat, and sodium—components of\\na dietary pattern that are often consumed above\\nrecommended limits beginning at an early age—also\\nwill support youth in achieving a healthy dietary pattern,\\nparticularly when considering the very limited amount of\\ncalories available outside of those needed for meeting\\nfood group and nutrient goals.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents | Page 76\\n\\n\\x0cAGES 2-18\\n\\nCurrent Intakes\\nFigure 3-2\\n\\nCurrent Intakes: Ages 2 Through 4\\nAverage Daily Food Group Intakes Compared to\\nRecommended Intake Ranges\\nRecommended Intake Ranges\\n\\nHealthy Eating Index Score\\n(on a scale of 0-100)\\n\\nAverage Intakes\\n\\n6\\n\\n61\\n\\nCUP or OZ EQUIVALENT\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\nM\\n\\nF\\nTotal\\nVegetables\\ncup eq/day\\n\\nM\\n\\nF\\nTotal\\nFruits\\ncup eq/day\\n\\nM\\n\\nF\\nTotal\\nGrains\\noz eq/day\\n\\nM\\n\\nF\\nTotal\\nDairy\\ncup eq/day\\n\\nM\\n\\nF\\nTotal\\nProtein Foods\\noz eq/day\\n\\nFOOD GROUPS\\n\\nPercent Exceeding Limits of Added Sugars,\\nSaturated Fat, and Sodium\\nAdded Sugars\\n\\nLimit: 10% of total energy\\n\\nMales\\n\\n61%\\n\\nFemales\\n\\n57%\\n\\nAverage Intakes\\nMales\\nFemales\\n173 kcal\\n158 kcal\\n\\nExceeding Limit\\n\\nSaturated Fat\\n\\nLimit: 10% of total energy\\n\\nMales\\n\\n87%\\n\\nFemales\\n\\n88%\\n\\nAverage Intakes\\nMales\\nFemales\\n191 kcal\\n177 kcal\\n\\nWithin Recommended Limit\\n\\nSodium\\n\\nLimit: 1,200 mg*\\n\\nMales\\n\\n97%\\n\\nFemales\\n\\n95%\\n\\nAverage Intakes\\nMales\\nFemales\\n2,274 mg\\n2,061 mg\\n\\n*NOTE: Children ages 2 through 3 should reduce sodium intake if above 1,200 mg/d and those age 4 should reduce intake if above 1,500 mg/d.\\nData Sources: Average Intakes and HEI-2015 Scores: Analysis of What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016, day 1 dietary intake data,\\nweighted.\\nRecommended Intake Ranges: Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Patterns (see Appendix 3).

For example, due to low intakes of\\nfood groups as described above, the nutrients of public\\nhealth concern—calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and\\ndietary fiber—apply to these life stages as well. Although\\nthe nutritional needs of youth are remarkably similar\\nto their parents, guardians, and caregivers, these age\\ngroups do have some special nutrition considerations.\\nSpecifically, increasing intakes of sugar-sweetened\\nbeverages and decreasing intakes of dairy are dietary\\ncomponents with notable and concerning shifts in\\nconsumption throughout youth. Dietary intake patterns\\nfor adolescents, particularly females, also are an area of\\nspecial consideration.\\nAccounting for the areas of dietary improvement that\\nare important for all children and adolescents, as well\\nas these special considerations, can improve diet quality\\nduring a time when food preferences and intake patterns\\nare formed. When consistently followed, these healthy\\ndietary patterns can provide the foundation for healthy\\ndietary patterns in adulthood, promote health among\\nyouth, and help prevent the onset of chronic disease\\nlater in life.\\n\\nSugar-Sweetened Beverages\\n\\nSugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., soda, fruit drinks,\\nsports and energy drinks) are not necessary in the\\nchild or adolescent diet nor are they a component of\\nthe USDA Dietary Patterns. Intake of added sugars\\n\\nincreases throughout childhood and adolescence, and\\nsugar-sweetened beverages are a top contributor. As\\na percent of total daily energy intake, average intake of\\nadded sugars is 11 percent among young children and\\npeaks at 15 percent during adolescence. Coinciding with\\nthis increase is the contribution of sugar-sweetened\\nbeverages to total intake of added sugars. In childhood,\\nsugar-sweetened beverages make up about 15 to 25\\npercent of total added sugars intake. By adolescence,\\ntheir contribution is 32 percent and even higher when\\nconsidering coffee and tea beverages with added\\nsugars (an additional 7 percent). Most sugar-sweetened\\nbeverages (e.g., soda, sports drinks) do not contribute\\nto meeting food group goals and often contain a high\\nnumber of calories.\\nDecreasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages\\nto reduce added sugars intake will help youth achieve\\na healthy dietary pattern. Beverages that contain no\\nadded sugars should be the primary choice for children\\nand adolescents. These include water and unsweetened\\nfat-free or low-fat milk—including low-lactose or lactosefree options or fortified soy beverage—and 100% juice\\nwithin recommended amounts. Consuming beverages\\nwith no added sugars is particularly important for young\\nchildren ages 2 through 8, when only a small number of\\ncalories remains for other uses after meeting food group\\nand nutrient needs with nutrient-dense choices (Table\\n3-1). The number of calories available for other uses\\nincreases slightly as energy needs increase throughout\\nadolescence to support growth and development\\n(Tables 3-2 and 3-3). However, most adolescents do not\\nconsume foods and beverages in their nutrient-dense\\nforms, meaning they have few or no calories remaining\\nfor added sugars.\\n\\nPage 87 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents\\n\\n\\x0cAG ES 2 -18\\n\\nJuice\\n\\nMany juice products, such as fruit drinks, contain minimal juice content and are considered\\nsugar-sweetened beverages because they are primarily composed of water with added sugars.\\nThe percent of juice in a beverage may be found on the package label, such as “contains 25%\\njuice” or “100% fruit juice.” The Nutrition Facts label identifies the amount of sugars in juice\\nproducts that are not naturally occurring (i.e., added sugars). Although 100% fruit juice without added sugars can\\nbe part of a healthy dietary pattern, it is lower in dietary fiber than whole fruit. Dietary fiber is a dietary component\\nof public health concern. With the recognition that fruit should mostly be consumed in whole forms, the amount\\nof fruit juice in the USDA Food Patterns ranges from 4 fluid ounces at the lower calorie levels and no more than 10\\nfluid ounces at the highest calorie levels.\\n\\nDairy and Fortified Soy Alternatives\\n\\nThroughout childhood and adolescence, the types of dairy foods\\nconsumed and their contribution to a healthy dietary pattern change. Milk\\nconsumption, particularly milk as a beverage, is lower and cheese intake,\\ntypically as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches, pizza, or pasta, is\\nhigher among adolescents when compared to younger children. These\\ndifferences in consumption occur alongside the widening gap between\\ncurrent and recommended intakes of dairy foods that occurs throughout\\nyouth. Nutrient-dense options within the dairy group are unsweetened\\nfat-free and low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified soy beverages\\nand yogurt, and low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products. Dairy and\\nfortified soy alternatives provide protein and a variety of nutrients that are\\nunderconsumed during these life stages. These include three nutrients\\nof public health concern discussed in Chapter 1: potassium, calcium,\\nand vitamin D. The nutrient composition of dairy foods highlights the\\nimportance of adequate consumption. This is especially relevant for\\ncalcium and vitamin D, given that adolescents have an increased need for\\nconsumption to support the accrual of bone mass.\\n\\nAdolescent Nutrition\\n\\nThe difference between recommended food group amounts and current\\nintakes is greater for adolescents ages 14 through 18 than for any other\\nage group across the lifespan. As a result, adolescents are at greater risk\\nof dietary inadequacy than are other age groups. For adolescent males\\nand females, low intakes of nutrient-dense foods and beverages within\\nthe grains, dairy and alternatives, fruits, and vegetables food groups\\nlead to low intakes of phosphorus, magnesium, and choline. Adolescent\\nfemales also consume less meat, poultry, and eggs than do adolescent\\nmales, and in combination with low consumption of seafood and other\\nprotein subgroups, including beans, peas, and lentils, this results in the\\nunderconsumption of total protein. In addition, adolescent females\\nhave low dietary intakes of iron, folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. The\\npotential for nutrient deficiencies existing alongside underconsumption of\\nnutrients of public health concern for all Americans creates a concerning\\nconstellation of nutritional risks at a time of rapid growth and development\\nalong with the onset of puberty, menarche, and hormonal changes.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents | Page 88\\n\\n\\x0cAGES 2-18\\n\\nSupporting\\nHealthy Eating\\nThe physical, mental, and emotional changes that occur\\nas children transition from pre-school to school-age\\nand into adolescence come with diverse and changing\\nopportunities to support a healthy dietary pattern.\\nSupport and active engagement from the various\\npeople and places involved in the lives of children and\\nadolescents is necessary to help establish and maintain\\nhealthy dietary patterns that support healthy weight and\\nthe prevention of chronic disease.\\nIn early childhood, parents, guardians, and caregivers\\nhave a primary role in supporting healthy eating because\\nthey control the foods and beverages purchased,\\nprepared, and served. Exposing young children to a\\nvariety of nutrient-dense foods within each food group\\nhelps build a healthy dietary pattern at an age when\\ntaste preferences are acquired. Introducing children to\\na variety of nutrient-dense foods can be challenging.\\nAs children grow, their search for a sense of autonomy\\nand desire for independence often manifest through\\nselective or “picky” eating, food neophobia, or food “jags”\\n(eating only one or a few foods for periods of time).\\nOffering the same type of food to children multiple\\ntimes, in a variety of forms, or prepared in different ways\\ncan increase acceptance and intake of healthy foods\\nwithin food groups. For example, children may show a\\n\\ndislike for vegetables in the cooked form but accept\\nthe raw version. Or, children may only accept fruit when\\nit is cut into small, bite-sized pieces. Even with these\\nstrategies, parents, guardians, and caregivers of young\\nchildren should know it may take up to 8 to 10 exposures\\nbefore a child will accept a new food.\\nChildren’s dietary patterns often resemble those of\\ntheir household, highlighting the importance of their\\nenvironment in the establishment of a healthy dietary\\npattern. Shared meals through shopping, cooking,\\nand consumption provides parents, guardians, and\\ncaregivers with an opportunity to model healthy\\neating behaviors and dietary practices. By making\\nnutrient-dense foods and beverages part of the normal\\nhousehold routine, children can observe and learn\\nhealthy behaviors that can extend throughout later\\nlife stages.\\nIdeally, children continue to be exposed to a healthy\\ndietary pattern as they experience changes to their daily\\nroutines, such as spending time in child care or school\\nsettings. As at home, eating occasions in these settings\\ncan be used as opportunities to support a healthy dietary\\npattern. For example, snacks can be used as a way to\\npromote intake of nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables,\\nlike carrot sticks and hummus or apple slices, instead\\nof foods like chips or cookies. Using snacks as an\\nopportunity to encourage nutrient-dense food group\\nchoices is especially relevant during early childhood\\nwhen the total volume of food consumed at regular\\nmeals is lower and snacking is common.\\nWhen exposed to nutrient-dense foods and beverages\\nat an early age and supported in making healthy choices\\nacross environments, a healthy dietary pattern can\\nbe established and maintained as children transition\\nto the adolescence life stage. With this transition\\ncomes increasing autonomy, increased influence of\\npeers, and decreased influence of parents, guardians,\\nand caregivers on food choice. As a result, foods and\\nbeverages are more commonly consumed outside of\\nthe home, often with a preference for convenience foods\\nthat often are not nutrient-dense. Parents, guardians,\\nand caregivers can continue to support healthy eating\\nduring this life stage by providing convenient access to\\nnutrient-dense foods; involving children and adolescents\\nin meal decisions, shopping, and cooking; and guiding\\nadolescents’ selection of food purchased and consumed\\noutside the home. In schools and community settings,\\nhealthy eating can be encouraged by creating an\\nenvironment that makes healthy choices the norm.\\n\\nPage 89 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 3: Children and Adolescents\\n\\n\\x0cAG ES 2 -18\\n\\nAccessing a Healthy Dietary Pattern\\n\\n• Outside of the school year, the Summer Food\\nService Program (SFSP) fills the gap by ensuring\\nthat children continue to receive nutritious meals\\nwhen school is not in session. The SFSP operates\\nat sites in a community where children can\\nreceive nutritious meals in a safe and\\nsupervised environment.\\n\\n• The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\\n(SNAP) provides temporary benefits to families with\\nqualifying incomes for the purchase of foods and\\nbeverages. About one-half of all SNAP participants\\nare children.1\\n\\nProfessionals working with youth and their families\\ncan use these, and additional Government and\\nnon-Government resources that exist at the community,\\nto support healthy eating during these life stages and to\\nestablish the foundation for a healthy dietary pattern that\\nwill promote health and support disease prevention in\\nlater years.\\n\\nMany resources exist to support healthy growth and\\ndevelopment during childhood and adolescence. The\\nfollowing Government programs play an essential role\\nin providing access to healthy meals and educational\\nresources to support healthy dietary patterns for all\\nchildren and adolescents.\\n\\n• Households with young children may be eligible for\\nthe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for\\nWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC can help\\nfamilies with limited resources meet their child’s\\nnutritional needs by providing nutritious foods to\\nsupplement diets. WIC serves children up to the age\\nof 5 years who are at nutritional risk.\\n• In childcare and afterschool settings, the Child\\nand Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) can\\nsupport the development of healthy dietary\\npatterns. CACFP is a nutrition program that provides\\nreimbursements for meals and snacks that align\\nwith the Dietary Guidelines to eligible children\\nenrolled at childcare centers, daycare homes,\\nand in afterschool programs.\\n• School-age children can benefit from the National\\nSchool Lunch Program and School Breakfast\\nProgram. The school meal programs can provide\\nnearly two-thirds of daily calories, and therefore play\\nan influential role in the development of a healthy\\ndietary pattern.\\n\\nLooking Toward\\nChapter 4: Adults\\nThis chapter focused on nutrition issues relevant to\\nchildren and adolescents. These issues are particularly\\nimportant because this life stage encompasses\\nsignificant transitions, from young children who are\\nstill dependent on parents, guardians, and caregivers\\nfor all their food choices, to adolescents who are\\nhighly independent in their food choices. Diet quality\\ntends to decrease as children mature into adolescence,\\nwith resulting concerns about underconsumption\\nof nutrients of public health concern. Establishing\\nand maintaining healthy food and beverages choices\\nnow can set a firm foundation for healthy dietary\\npatterns that reduce the risk of diet-related chronic\\ndisease, an issue of increasing relevance to adults,\\nwho are considered in the next chapter.\\n\\n1Source:\\n\\nCharacteristics of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Households: Fiscal Year 2018.

Balancing work or school\\nresponsibilities with personal, family,\\nor other commitments can create real\\nor perceived barriers to healthy eating.\\nConstraints on available time and financial\\nresources may make it challenging for\\nadults to adopt and maintain a healthy\\ndietary pattern. Support for healthy food\\nand beverage choices across the multiple\\nplaces where adults live, work, play,\\nand gather is needed to improve dietary\\npatterns among adults.\\n\\nPage 93 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults\\n\\nMany individuals enter the adult\\nlife stage with an unhealthy dietary\\npattern already established from\\nthe childhood and adolescent years.\\nA concerted effort to change this\\ntrajectory and support adults in\\nadopting a healthy dietary pattern\\nis needed for better health and to\\npromote the well-being of family and\\nfriends across life stages. Learned\\nfood and beverage preferences, and\\nnorms and values placed on diet,\\nphysical activity, and health, can\\npositively or negatively influence\\nhealth because they can determine\\nan individual’s willingness to change\\nand maintain behaviors.

Improving dietary\\npatterns in adulthood can play a\\nbeneficial role in promoting health\\nand preventing the onset or rate of\\nprogression of chronic disease. For\\nadults with overweight or obesity,\\nmaking healthful changes to dietary\\npatterns and increasing physical\\nactivity will improve health and\\nprevent additional weight gain and/\\nor promote weight loss (see “The\\nImportance of Physical Activity” and\\n“Overweight and Obesity”).\\n\\n\\x0cA D U LT S AG ES 19-59\\n\\nThe Importance of Physical Activity\\nAdults who are physically active are healthier, feel better, and are less\\nlikely to develop many chronic diseases than are adults who are inactive.\\nFor adults, regular physical activity can provide both immediate benefits\\n(e.g., boost mood, reduce stress, improve sleep) and long-term benefits\\n(e.g., improved bone health and reduced risk of many diseases, such as\\ncardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, dementia, and many\\ntypes of cancer).\\nAdults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical\\nactivity is better than none. To attain the most health benefits from\\nphysical activity, adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderateintensity aerobic activity, like brisk walking or fast dancing, each week.\\nAdults also need muscle-strengthening activity, like lifting weights or\\ndoing push-ups, at least 2 days each week.\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity\\nGuidelines for Americans and related Move Your Way® resources have\\nmore information about the benefits of physical activity and tips on how\\nto get started. Available at health.gov/paguidelines.\\n\\nOverweight and Obesity\\nIn the United States, 74 percent of adults have overweight or obesity,\\ncreating an increased risk for the development of other chronic health\\nconditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain\\ntypes of cancer.\\nLosing weight and maintaining weight loss is not a simple task. It\\nrequires adults to reduce the number of calories they get from foods\\nand beverages and increase the amount expended through physical\\nactivity. Weight loss and maintenance are not likely achieved using\\nshort-term solutions. They require a commitment to long-term lifestyle\\nchange and often need support from healthcare providers, family\\nmembers, and social networks. Intensive behavioral interventions that\\nuse one or more strategies—like group sessions and changes in both\\ndiet and physical activity—can be effective for individuals trying to lose\\na significant amount of weight. In addressing obesity, professionals\\nshould be mindful of health problems stemming from obesity-related\\nstigma and discrimination.\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website provides\\nresources to support preventing weight gain (cdc.gov/healthyweight/\\nprevention/index.html) and losing weight (cdc.gov/healthyweight/\\nlosing_weight/index.html).\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults | Page 94\\n\\n\\x0cA D ULTS AGES 19-5 9\\n\\nHealthy Dietary\\nPatterns\\nAdults are encouraged to follow the\\nrecommendations on the types of foods and\\nbeverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern\\ndescribed in Chapter 1.

These considerations include\\na focus on dietary changes to increase intakes of dietary\\nfiber, calcium, and vitamin D and to decrease intakes\\nof added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Special\\nconsiderations related to alcoholic beverages also\\nare discussed.\\n\\nDietary Fiber\\n\\nDietary patterns that do not meet recommended\\nintakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\\ncontribute to low intakes of dietary fiber. More than\\n90 percent of women and 97 percent of men do not\\nmeet recommended intakes for dietary fiber. This\\naligns with intake patterns where fruits, vegetables,\\nand whole grains are underconsumed by more than\\n85 percent of adults. Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for\\nAge-Sex Groups provides dietary fiber goals for men\\nand women based on the Dietary Reference Intakes.\\nThese recommendations are based on levels observed\\nto reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Increasing\\nintakes of fruits, vegetables, and replacing refined\\ngrains with whole grains to improve dietary fiber intakes\\nis especially important during this life stage, as the\\nimpact of poor diet quality becomes apparent with\\nthe onset and/or progression of diet-related chronic\\ndiseases. Chapter 1 provides strategies on how to\\nincrease intakes of these important food groups. A list\\nof common food sources of dietary fiber is available at\\nDietaryGuidelines.gov.\\n\\nCalcium and Vitamin D\\n\\nCalcium and vitamin D are important at any age, and\\nmost adults do not consume adequate amounts.\\nClose to 30 percent of men and 60 percent of women\\nolder than age 19 years do not consume enough\\ncalcium, and more than 90 percent do not consume\\nenough vitamin D. Dietary patterns that do not meet\\nrecommended intake amounts for food groups and\\nsubgroups, which include sources of calcium and\\nvitamin D—such as dairy foods and fortified soy\\nalternatives and seafood—contribute to low intake of\\n\\nthese nutrients. Particular attention should be given\\nto consuming adequate amounts of foods with these\\nnutrients during adult years to promote optimal bone\\nhealth and prevent the onset of osteoporosis. Adequate\\nintake of calcium and vitamin D is particularly\\nimportant for adults during the time period when peak\\nbone mass is still actively accruing (ages 19 through\\nabout 30) and, for women, in the post-menopausal\\nperiod when rapid bone remodeling occurs.\\nA healthy dietary pattern with nutrient-dense,\\ncalcium-rich foods, such as low-fat milk and yogurt\\nand fortified soy alternatives and canned sardines\\nand salmon, can help adults better meet intake\\nrecommendations. Vitamin D aids in the absorption\\nof calcium. Consuming the recommended amount\\nof seafood and choosing foods that are fortified with\\nvitamin D, including milk, fortified soy beverages, and\\nfortified soy yogurt, and some whole-grain cereals,\\ncan help adults meet their needs. In addition to dietary\\nsources, the body can make vitamin D from the\\n\\nPage 101 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults\\n\\n\\x0cA D U LT S AG ES 19-59\\n\\nAbout 70 to 75 percent of adults exceed the 10-percent\\nlimit on saturated fat as a result of selecting foods and\\nbeverages across food groups that are not in nutrientdense forms. The top sources of saturated fat for\\nadults are sandwiches (e.g., deli sandwiches, burgers,\\ntacos, burritos, grilled cheese, hot dogs) and other\\ngrain-based mixed dishes (e.g. spaghetti and meatballs,\\ncasseroles, quesadillas) that typically contain\\ningredients from several food groups that are not in\\nnutrient-dense forms, including grains, protein foods,\\nand dairy. Making changes to the type of ingredients as\\nwell as amount and/or frequency of their consumption\\nwill help adults lower saturated fat intake without a\\nneed to eliminate these foods from the household diet.\\nStrategies include using lean meats and low-fat cheese\\nto prepare these foods or substituting beans in place\\nof meats as the protein source. Saturated fat also can\\nbe reduced by substituting certain ingredients with\\nsources of unsaturated fat (e.g., using avocado, nuts,\\nor seeds in a dish instead of cheese). Cooking with oils\\nhigher in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat\\n(e.g., canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and\\nsunflower) instead of butter also can reduce intakes\\nof saturated fat.\\n\\nSodium\\n\\nsun. However, some individuals may have difficulty\\nproducing sufficient vitamin D from sunlight exposure\\nor consuming enough vitamin D from foods and\\nbeverages, so a supplement may be recommended\\nby a health professional. Appendix 1 provides calcium\\nand vitamin D goals for men and women based on\\nthe Dietary Reference Intakes. A list of common\\nfood sources of calcium and vitamin D is available at\\nDietaryGuidelines.gov.\\n\\nSaturated Fat\\n\\nChapter 1 explains the importance of limiting intakes\\nof saturated fat to support healthy dietary patterns.\\nStaying within saturated fat limits and replacing\\nsaturated fat with unsaturated fat is of particular\\nimportance during the adult life stage. The prevalence\\nof coronary heart disease increases with age, and high\\nLDL cholesterol peaks between the ages of 50 to\\n59 in men and 60 to 69 in women.\\n\\nThe number of adults exceeding the Chronic Disease\\nRisk Reduction level for sodium (see Chapter 1 or\\nAppendix 1) during this life stage is concerning given\\nthat 45 percent of adults ages 18 and older are living\\nwith hypertension. During adulthood, prevalence of\\nhypertension increases from about 22 percent of\\nadults ages 18 through 39 to about 55 percent of\\nadults ages 40 through 59.1 Changing this trend is\\nimportant because hypertension is a preventable risk\\nfactor for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Unlike\\nother factors that cannot be changed, such as genetics\\nand family history, reduced dietary intake of sodium\\nis a modifiable risk factor that can help improve blood\\npressure control and reduce risk of hypertension.\\nOverconsumption of sodium occurs for several\\nreasons, as discussed in Chapter 1. Because sodium is\\nfound in foods and beverages across all food groups,\\nwith most coming from foods that have salt added\\nduring commercial processing rather than salt added\\nto foods during or after preparation, reducing sodium\\nconsumption will require a joint effort by individuals,\\nthe food and beverage industry, and food service and\\nretail establishments.\\n\\n1 Ostchega\\n\\nY, Fryar CD, Nwankwo T, Nguyen DT.

Added sugars are of\\nparticular concern for adults because exceeding limits\\ncontributes to excess calorie intake.\\nBEVERAGES AS A SOURCE OF ADDED SUGARS\\nSugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., soda, sports drinks,\\nenergy drinks, fruit drinks) and sweetened coffees\\nand teas (including ready-to-drink varieties) contribute\\nover 40 percent of daily intake of added sugars. More\\nthan in earlier life stages, adults consume coffees and\\nteas with additions, such as sugar and flavored syrup.\\nFrequent consumption of these and other beverages\\ncontaining added sugars can contribute to excess\\ncalorie intake. Some sugar-sweetened beverages, such\\nas coffee and tea with milk, contribute to food group\\nintake (e.g., dairy) and can be made without added\\nsugars. Others, such as fruit drinks, can be replaced\\nwith nutrient-dense options such as 100% juice to help\\nmeet fruit group recommendations.\\nMost adults’ diets include choices across multiple\\nfood groups that are not in nutrient-dense forms and\\ntherefore cannot accommodate excess calories from\\n2 Additional\\n\\nsweetened beverages. Intake of sugar-sweetened\\nbeverages should be limited to small amounts and\\nmost often replaced with beverage options that contain\\nno added sugars, such as water.\\nOTHER SOURCES OF ADDED SUGARS\\nA variety of foods and beverages contribute to the\\nremaining added sugars consumed by adults. In\\naddition to the contribution of sugar-sweetened\\nbeverages and sweetened coffees and teas, about\\n30 percent come from desserts and sweet snacks,\\ncandies, and sweetened breakfast cereals. The\\nremaining 30 percent of added sugars is consumed in\\nrelatively small amounts across many food categories,\\nas discussed in Chapter 1. Many of these food\\ncategories have seen market expansion in recent years.\\nFor example, over the past decade, beverages, snacks,\\nand bakery foods have continuously topped the list\\nfor the most new product introductions.2 As these and\\nother food categories continue to change and expand,\\nit is vital for individuals to learn how to identify the\\namount of added sugars in a beverage or food product\\nby reading the Nutrition Facts label (see Chapter 1).\\nUnderstanding which food choices contribute to intakes\\nof added sugars without contributing to nutrient needs\\ncan help individuals remove or replace these foods\\nwith better choices that meet food group and nutrient\\nrecommendations within calorie needs.\\n\\ninformation is available at ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/processing-marketing/new-products.aspx.\\n\\nPage 103 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults\\n\\n\\x0cA D U LT S AG ES 19-59\\n\\nAlcoholic Beverages\\n\\nAlcoholic beverages are not a component of the USDA\\nDietary Patterns and their calories are considered\\ndiscretionary. Regular consumption of alcoholic\\nbeverages can make it challenging for adults to meet\\nfood group and nutrient needs while not consuming\\nexcess calories. The ingredients in certain mixed drinks,\\nincluding soda, mixers, and heavy cream, also can\\ncontribute to intake of added sugars and saturated fat.\\nThe majority of U.S. adults consume alcoholic\\nbeverages. About 66 percent of adults ages 21 through\\n59 report alcoholic beverage consumption in the\\npast month, and of those, approximately half report\\nbinge drinking, sometimes multiple times per month.\\nAmong adults who choose to drink, average intakes\\nof calories from alcoholic beverages exceed the\\nremaining calorie limit that is available after food group\\nrecommendations are met.\\nThere are some adults who should not drink alcoholic\\nbeverages at all, such as if they are pregnant or might\\nbe pregnant; younger than age 21; or recovering from\\nan alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control\\nthe amount they drink. For those who choose to drink,\\nintakes should be limited to 1 drink or less in a day\\nfor women and 2 drinks or less in a day for men, on\\ndays when alcohol is consumed. More information in\\navailable in Chapter 1 under Alcoholic Beverages.\\n\\nSupporting\\nHealthy Eating\\nIndividuals need support in making healthy choices\\nat home, work, and in the community to build healthy\\ndietary patterns.\\nFood retail outlets (e.g., grocery stores, convenience\\nstores, restaurants) provide adults with the option to\\npurchase ingredients to prepare foods themselves or\\nto purchase foods prepared by others. National food\\nexpenditures suggest the purchase of prepared foods\\nis a regular habit for most adults, with expenditures\\noutpacing those of foods purchased for household\\nmeal preparation.3 Estimates also suggest that the\\nyounger generation of American adults are spending\\nan even larger proportion of their total food dollars on\\nprepared foods than are older generations.4\\n\\nWhen adults prepare meals themselves, they have more\\ncontrol over the types of food ingredients selected and\\ncan focus on choosing nutrient-dense options that\\ncontribute to food group goals with little or no added\\nsugars and saturated fat and less sodium. The same\\nis not always true when purchasing prepared foods,\\ndespite changes and innovation in the marketplace,\\nsuch as menu and product labeling or reformulation.\\nFor some adults, preparing and consuming healthy\\nmeals at home will mean adopting a new habit and/or\\nlearning new skills, such as meal planning. For others, it\\nmay entail small changes to current routines. Planning\\nmeals and snacks in advance with food groups and\\nnutrient-dense foods and beverages in mind can\\nsupport healthy eating at home and improve dietary\\npatterns of individuals and families. Preparing meals\\nwith family and friends also presents an opportunity\\nfor greater connection and enjoyment around food.\\nFor adults who are parents, guardians, or caregivers of\\nchildren or adolescents, preparing meals also provides\\nan opportunity to teach valuable cooking skills and\\nmodel behaviors that support the adoption of healthy\\ndietary patterns across younger life stages.\\n\\n3 Details\\n\\nare available at ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/96957/ap-083.pdf?v=5848.3.\\nDetails are available at ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2017/december/millennials-devote-larger-shares-of-their-grocery-spending-toprepared-foods-pasta-and-sugar-and-sweets-than-other-generations.\\n4\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults | Page 104\\n\\n\\x0cA D ULTS AGES 19-5 9\\n\\nIt is not realistic or desirable to avoid the purchase and\\nconsumption of foods prepared by others. Limits on\\navailable time and the desire for convenience make\\nrestaurant and ready-to-eat meals a part of many\\nhousehold routines. Many of these settings also\\nprovide for social enjoyment of food with friends and\\nfamily. However, foods prepared outside of the home\\ncan contribute to the overconsumption of calories\\nas a result of large portion sizes and methods of\\npreparation. Being mindful of the portion sizes and\\ningredients of prepared foods can help adults achieve\\na healthy dietary pattern while still enjoying foods\\nprepared by others. Health promotion activities that\\ncenter on increasing consumer knowledge and access\\nto healthy options in the places where Americans\\npurchase prepared foods are needed to provide\\nsupport for adults in these efforts.\\nHealth professionals play an important role in\\nsupporting adults’ healthy eating behaviors. Helping\\nadults become more aware of the foods and\\nbeverages that make up their typical dietary patterns\\nand identifying areas for improvement can empower\\nindividuals to make changes to the types of foods they\\npurchase or prepare. Teaching skills like cooking and\\nmeal planning and helping adults understand how to\\nread labels or make healthy menu substitutions also\\nwill support the adoption of a healthy dietary pattern\\nduring this life stage.\\nIn settings where adults spend their time, changing\\norganizational practices, approaches, and/or policies\\nto support improved dietary patterns also is needed.\\nStrategies include offering healthy meals and snacks\\nin workplace cafeterias and vending machines, or\\nimplementing educational programs tailored to\\nworking adults. Or, communities can support farmers\\nmarkets, community gardens, and related educational\\nprogramming efforts.\\n\\nAccessing a Healthy Dietary Pattern\\n\\nA healthy dietary pattern can only be achieved when\\nadequate resources and supports exist in the places\\nwhere adults live, work, and gather. Food access is\\ncrucial for adults to achieve a healthy dietary pattern\\nand is influenced by diverse factors, as discussed\\nin Chapter 1. Food insecurity, which occurs when\\naccess to nutritionally adequate and safe food is\\nlimited or uncertain, is most prevalent in households\\nwith children and in single-parent households. Income\\nis one of the primary characteristics associated with\\nfood insecurity. Government programs, such as the\\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or\\nthe Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations\\n(FDPIR), serve as a resource for low-income adults\\nby supplementing food budgets to support healthy\\nlifestyles. Adults with children or those caring for older\\nfamily members also may benefit from resources\\ndiscussed in Chapters 2, 3, and 6.\\nAdditional Government and non-Government\\nresources, such as food banks or community meal\\nsites and programming offered through SNAP\\nEducation (SNAP-Ed) and the Expanded Food and\\nNutrition Education Program (EFNEP), play a role in\\nproviding food and educational resources to support\\nadults in making healthy food choices within a limited\\nbudget. Innovative approaches to support health, such\\nas incentive programs at farmers markets or healthy\\ncorner-store initiatives, continue to expand. Continued\\nattention and creativity in approaches to expand\\nfood access are needed to support a healthy dietary\\npattern for adults and the larger social networks that\\nthey influence.\\n\\nLearn More\\nThe Federal Foodservice Guidelines is a\\nresource that food service providers can use\\nto help make healthy choices more available in\\nfood service establishments. The Guidelines are\\navailable at cdc.gov/nutrition/healthy-foodenvironments/food-serv-guide.html.\\n\\nPage 105 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults\\n\\n\\x0cA D U LT S AG ES 19-59\\n\\nLooking Toward Chapter 5:\\nWomen Who Are Pregnant or Lactating\\nand Chapter 6: Older Adults\\nThis chapter has discussed the importance of\\na healthy dietary pattern and related special\\nconsiderations during the adult life stage. The chapter\\nrecognizes that dietary patterns are generally well\\nestablished by the time individuals reach adulthood\\nand encourages adults to take advantage of the many\\nopportunities available to make changes that support\\na healthy dietary pattern. Making these changes\\ncan have important benefits for achieving a healthy\\nweight status, reducing chronic disease risk, and\\n\\npromoting overall health. These considerations are\\nespecially important for the life stages discussed in\\nthe next two chapters. Chapter 5 takes a closer look\\nat a special time in the life of many adults—pregnancy\\nand lactation. This chapter echoes the same guidance\\nfor adults on following a healthy dietary pattern and\\ndiscusses several special considerations that arise\\nduring this life stage. Chapter 6 then makes the\\ntransition from the Adults chapter to a focused look at\\nhealthy eating for older adults.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 4: Adults | Page 106\\n\\n\\x0cWOME N W H O AR E PR EGNANT O R L ACTAT ING\\n\\nPage 107 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating\\n\\n\\x0cWO M E N W H O A R E P R EG N A N T O R LACTATING\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\n5\\n\\nWomen Who\\nAre Pregnant\\nor Lactating\\n\\nDietary\\nDietaryGuidelines\\nGuidelinesfor\\nforAmericans,\\nAmericans,2020-2025\\n2020-2025 || Chapter\\nChapter5:\\n5:Women\\nWomenWho\\nWhoAre\\nArePregnant\\nPregnantor\\norLactating\\nLactating | Page 108\\n\\n\\x0cWOME N W H O AR E PR EGNANT O R L ACTAT ING\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nP\\n\\nregnancy and lactation are special stages\\nof life for women, and nutrition plays a\\nvital role before, during, and after these life\\nstages to support the health of the mother\\nand her child. Following a healthy dietary\\npattern is especially important for those who\\nare pregnant or lactating for several reasons.\\nIncreased calorie and nutrient intakes\\nare necessary to support the growth and\\ndevelopment of the baby and to maintain\\nthe mother’s health. Consuming a healthy\\ndietary pattern before and during pregnancy\\nalso may improve pregnancy outcomes. In\\naddition, following a healthy dietary pattern\\nbefore and during pregnancy and lactation\\nhas the potential to affect health outcomes\\nfor both the mother and child in subsequent\\nlife stages.\\n\\nThis chapter addresses some\\nimportant nutritional considerations\\nfor women before pregnancy and\\ncontains nutrition guidance for\\nwomen during pregnancy and\\nlactation. A healthy dietary pattern,\\nalong with changing calorie and\\nnutrient needs during pregnancy and\\nlactation, are described throughout\\nthe chapter. Special consideration is\\ngiven to the importance of achieving\\nand maintaining a healthy weight\\nbefore pregnancy, gaining weight\\nwithin gestational weight gain\\nguidelines, and returning to a healthy\\nweight during the postpartum\\nperiod. A healthy weight status\\nduring these life stages has shortand long-term health benefits for the\\nmother and her child. The chapter\\nalso discusses other considerations\\nimportant to pregnancy and\\nlactation, including those related\\nto intake of seafood, alcohol, and\\ncaffeinated beverages. Finally,\\nduring pregnancy, nausea, vomiting,\\nfood aversions, and food cravings\\ncan make it difficult for some\\nwomen to achieve optimal dietary\\nintake. The chapter discusses how\\nthese can be considered when\\nhelping women who are pregnant\\nor lactating make healthy food and\\nbeverage choices.\\n\\nPage 109 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating\\n\\n\\x0cWO M E N W H O A R E P R EG N A N T O R LACTATING\\n\\nHealthy Dietary\\nPatterns\\nWomen who are pregnant or lactating are encouraged\\nto follow the recommendations on the types of\\nfoods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary\\npattern described in Chapter 1. Nutrition and Health\\nAcross the Lifespan: The Dietary Guidelines and Key\\nRecommendations. The core elements of a healthy diet\\nfor women during these life stages are similar to the\\nrecommendations for women who are not pregnant.\\nTable 5-1 shows the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern\\nto illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food\\ngroups and other dietary components that make up\\nhealthy dietary patterns at the six calorie levels most\\nrelevant to women who are pregnant or lactating.\\nFollowing a healthy dietary pattern during these life\\nstages can help women meet the Guidelines and its\\nKey Recommendations. The USDA Dietary Patterns are\\ndiscussed in greater detail in Chapter 1 and Appendix 3.\\nUSDA Dietary Patterns.\\nTable 5-2 summarizes estimated daily calorie\\nneeds during pregnancy and lactation compared\\nto prepregnancy needs for women with a healthy\\nprepregnancy weight. Additional information on\\nestimates of prepregnancy calorie needs is provided in\\nTable 5-1 (footnote a) and in Appendix 2. Estimated\\nCalorie Needs. As shown in Table 5-2, calorie needs\\ngenerally increase as pregnancy progresses and remain\\nelevated during lactation. However, it is important to\\nnote that women with a prepregnancy weight that is\\nconsidered overweight or obese have lower weight\\ngain recommendations than do women with a healthy\\nprepregnancy weight (see “Weight Management”).\\nWomen should follow their healthcare provider’s\\nguidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during\\npregnancy and lactation, as many factors, including\\nprepregnancy weight status, gestational weight gain,\\nand multiple pregnancies, may affect calorie needs.\\nIn general, it is important for women who are pregnant\\nto be under the care of a healthcare provider who\\ncan monitor their health status and the progress of\\ntheir pregnancy.\\n\\nof pregnancy and throughout lactation. In short, women\\nshould meet their increased calorie and nutrient needs\\nwith nutrient-dense foods instead of with foods high in\\nadded sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.\\nThe customizable components of the USDA Dietary\\nPatterns provide flexibility that allows women—or\\nprofessionals adapting these patterns—to choose from a\\nvariety of foods and beverages within each food group to\\nsuit individual preference, lifestyle, traditions, culture, and\\nbudget. This flexibility in being able to select among a\\nvariety of nutrient-dense options is particularly important\\nfor women who experience pregnancy-induced nausea,\\nvomiting, or food aversions.\\nWhen making food and beverage choices, women\\nshould know that unless it’s medically indicated to\\navoid for her own health, women do not need to restrict\\ntheir choices during pregnancy or lactation to prevent\\nfood allergy from developing in their child. However,\\nwomen who are pregnant should pay attention to some\\nimportant food safety considerations (see “Food Safety\\nDuring Pregnancy”).\\n\\nNutrient-Dense Foods\\nand Beverages\\n\\nNutrient-dense foods and\\nbeverages provide vitamins,\\nminerals, and other health-promoting\\ncomponents and have little added sugars,\\nsaturated fat, and sodium. Vegetables, fruits,\\nwhole grains, seafood, eggs, beans, peas, and\\nlentils, unsalted nuts\\nand seeds, fat-free and\\nlow-fat dairy products,\\nand lean meats and\\npoultry—when prepared\\nwith no or little added\\nsugars, saturated\\nfat, and sodium—are\\nnutrient-dense foods.\\n\\nThe increased calorie and nutrient needs for these life\\nstages should be met by consuming nutrient-dense food\\nchoices as part of a healthy dietary pattern. One way to\\nachieve this is to follow the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary\\nPattern throughout pregnancy and lactation, but adjust\\nintake of food groups to reflect higher calorie patterns\\nrecommended during the second and third trimesters\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating | Page 110\\n\\n\\x0cWOME N W H O AR E PR EGNANT O R L ACTAT ING\\n\\nTable 5-1\\n\\nHealthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern for Women Who Are\\nPregnant or Lactating, With Daily or Weekly Amounts From\\nFood Groups, Subgroups, and Components\\nCALORIE LEVEL OF PATTERNa\\n\\n1,800\\n\\n2,000\\n\\n2,200\\n\\n2,400\\n\\n2,600\\n\\n2,800\\n\\nDaily Amount of Food From Each Group\\n(Vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week.)\\n\\nFOOD GROUP OR SUBGROUPb\\nVegetables (cup eq/day)\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3½\\n\\n3½\\n\\nVegetable Subgroups in Weekly Amounts\\nDark-Green Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\nRed & Orange Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\nBeans, Peas, Lentils (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\nStarchy Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\nOther Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5½\\n\\n5½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2½\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\nWhole Grains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4½\\n\\n5\\n\\nRefined Grains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3½\\n\\n4\\n\\n4½\\n\\n5\\n\\nDairy (cup eq/day)\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\nProtein Foods (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n5\\n\\n5½\\n\\n6\\n\\n6½\\n\\n6½\\n\\n7\\n\\nFruits (cup eq/day)\\nGrains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\nProtein Foods Subgroups in Weekly Amounts\\nMeats, Poultry, Eggs (ounce eq/wk)\\n\\n23\\n\\n26\\n\\n28\\n\\n31\\n\\n31\\n\\n33\\n\\nSeafood (ounce eq/wk)c\\n\\n8\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\n10\\n\\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products (ounce eq/wk)\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n24\\n\\n27\\n\\n29\\n\\n31\\n\\n34\\n\\n36\\n\\n140\\n\\n240\\n\\n250\\n\\n320\\n\\n350\\n\\n370\\n\\n8%\\n\\n12%\\n\\n11%\\n\\n13%\\n\\n13%\\n\\n13%\\n\\nOils (grams/day)\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses\\n\\n(kcal/day)d\\n\\nLimit on Calories for Other Uses (%/day)\\na Calorie\\n\\nlevel ranges: Prepregnancy energy levels are calculated\\nbased on median height and body weight for healthy body mass\\nindex (BMI) for a reference woman, who is 5 feet 4 inches tall and\\nweighs 126 pounds.

For example, the nutrients of\\npublic health concern—calcium, vitamin D, potassium,\\nand dietary fiber—apply to these life stages as well.\\nIn addition, iron is a nutrient of public health concern\\nfor women who are pregnant. These life stages also\\nhave some special nutrient and dietary considerations\\nregarding folate, iodine, choline, seafood, alcoholic\\nbeverages, and caffeinated beverages that are discussed\\nin the following sections of this chapter.\\n\\nMeeting Nutrient Needs\\n\\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, nutritional needs should be\\nmet primarily through foods and beverages. However,\\nthis may be difficult for some women, especially\\nthose who are pregnant. Most healthcare providers\\nrecommend women who are pregnant or planning to\\nbecome pregnant take a daily prenatal vitamin and\\nmineral supplement in addition to consuming a healthy\\ndietary pattern. This may be especially important to\\nmeet folate/folic acid, iron, iodine, and vitamin D needs\\nduring pregnancy (see Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for\\nAge-Sex Groups).\\nNutrient needs for women who are lactating differ from\\nthose who are pregnant. Continued use of prenatal\\nsupplements by women who are lactating may exceed\\ntheir needs for folic acid and iron. Women who are\\nlactating should not exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake\\nLevel (UL) of 1,000 micrograms of folic acid and 45\\nmilligrams of iron. Women should seek guidance from\\na healthcare provider on appropriate use of prenatal or\\nother dietary supplements during lactation.\\n\\nFolate/Folic Acid\\n\\nThe RDA for folate is higher during pregnancy and\\nlactation than all other life stages (see Appendix 1).\\nAdequate folic acid intake is particularly important prior\\nto conception and during the first trimester to help\\nprevent neural tube defects.\\nThe United States Preventative Services Task Force\\n(USPSTF) recommends that all women who are planning\\nor capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement\\ncontaining 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid. The critical\\nperiod for supplementation starts at least 1 month\\nbefore conception and continues through the first 2 to 3\\n\\nmonths of pregnancy. Dietary supplements may contain\\neither folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF),\\nbut only folic acid has been shown to prevent neural tube\\ndefects. Most prenatal supplements sold in the United\\nStates contain folic acid.\\nThe recommendation for folic acid supplementation is\\nin addition to the amounts of food folate contained in\\na healthy eating pattern. Folate is found inherently in\\ndark-green vegetables and beans, peas, and lentils. All\\nenriched grains (i.e., bread, pasta, rice, and cereal) and\\nsome corn masa flours are fortified with folic acid.\\n\\nIron\\n\\nIron needs increase during pregnancy compared to\\nprepregnancy. For women who are lactating, before\\nmenstruation returns, iron needs fall and then return\\nto prepregnancy levels once menstruation resumes\\n(see Appendix 1).\\nIron is a key nutrient during pregnancy that supports\\nfetal development. Iron deficiency affects about 1 in\\n10 women who are pregnant and 1 in 4 women during\\ntheir third trimester. Heme iron, which is found in animal\\nsource foods (e.g., lean meats, poultry, and some\\nseafood) is more readily absorbed by the body than the\\nnon-heme iron found in plant source foods (e.g., beans,\\npeas, lentils, and dark-green vegetables). Additional iron\\nsources include foods enriched or fortified with\\niron, such as many whole-wheat breads and ready-to-eat\\n\\nPage 115 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating\\n\\n\\x0cWO M E N W H O A R E P R EG N A N T O R LACTATING\\n\\nMore than half of women continue to use prenatal\\nsupplements during lactation. Most prenatal\\nsupplements are designed to meet the higher iron needs\\nof pregnancy. Depending on various factors—such as\\nwhen menstruation returns—prenatal supplements\\nmay exceed the iron needs of women who are lactating.\\nWomen should seek guidance from a healthcare\\nprovider regarding the appropriate level of iron\\nsupplementation during lactation based on their\\nunique needs.\\n\\nIodine\\n\\nIodine needs increase substantially during pregnancy and\\nlactation (see Appendix 1). Adequate iodine intake during\\npregnancy is important for neurocognitive development\\nof the fetus. Although women of reproductive age\\ngenerally have adequate iodine intake, some women,\\nparticularly those who do not regularly consume dairy\\nproducts, eggs, seafood, or use iodized table salt, may\\nnot consume enough iodine to meet increased needs\\nduring pregnancy and lactation.\\ncereals. Absorption of iron from non-heme sources is\\nenhanced by consuming them along with vitamin C-rich\\nfoods. Food source lists for both heme and non-heme\\niron are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Women\\nwho are pregnant or who are planning to become\\npregnant are advised to take a supplement containing\\niron when recommended by an obstetrician or other\\nhealthcare provider.\\n\\nWomen who are pregnant or lactating should not be\\nencouraged to start using table salt if they do not do so\\nalready. However, they should ensure that any table salt\\nused in cooking or added to food at the table is iodized.\\nAdditionally, women who are pregnant or lactating may\\nneed a supplement containing iodine in order to achieve\\nadequate intake. Many prenatal supplements do not\\ncontain iodine. Thus, it is important to read the label.\\n\\nVegetarian or Vegan Dietary Patterns\\nDuring Pregnancy and Lactation\\n\\nWomen following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern\\nduring these life stages may need to take special care\\nto ensure nutrient adequacy. Iron may be of particular\\nconcern because plant source foods only contain\\nnon-heme iron, which is less bioavailable than heme\\niron. Food source lists for both heme and non-heme\\niron are available at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Vitamin\\nB12 also is of concern because it is present only in\\nanimal source foods. Women following a vegetarian or\\nvegan dietary pattern should consult with a healthcare\\nprovider to determine whether supplementation of iron,\\nvitamin B12, and/or other nutrients such as choline,\\nzinc, iodine , or EPA/DHA is necessary and if so, the\\nappropriate levels to meet their unique needs.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating | Page 116\\n\\n\\x0cWOME N W H O AR E PR EGNANT O R L ACTAT ING\\n\\nCholine\\n\\nCholine needs also increase during pregnancy and\\nlactation (see Appendix 1). Adequate intake of choline\\nduring these life stages helps to both replenish maternal\\nstores and support the growth and development of the\\nchild’s brain and spinal cord.\\nMost women do not meet recommended intakes of\\ncholine during pregnancy and lactation. Women are\\nencouraged to consume a variety of choline-containing\\nfoods during these life stages. Choline can be found\\nthroughout many food groups and subgroups. Meeting\\nrecommended intakes for the dairy and protein\\nfood groups—with eggs, meats, and some seafood\\nbeing notable sources—as well as the beans, peas,\\nand lentils subgroup can help meet choline needs.\\nMeeting nutrient needs through foods and beverages\\nis preferred, but women who are concerned about\\nmeeting recommendations should speak with their\\nhealthcare provider to determine whether choline\\nsupplementation is appropriate. Many prenatal\\nsupplements do not contain choline or only contain\\nsmall amounts inadequate to meet recommendations.\\n\\nSeafood\\n\\nSeafood intake during pregnancy is recommended, as\\nit is associated with favorable measures of cognitive\\ndevelopment in young children. Women who are\\npregnant or lactating should consume at least 8 and\\nup to 12 ounces of a variety of seafood per week, from\\nchoices lower in methylmercury. The U.S. Food and\\n\\nDrug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental\\nProtection Agency (EPA) provide joint advice regarding\\nseafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure\\nfor women who might become or who are pregnant\\nor lactating. Methylmercury can be harmful to the\\nbrain and nervous system if a person is exposed to\\ntoo much of it over time; this is particularly important\\nduring pregnancy because eating too much of it can\\nhave negative effects on the developing fetus. Based\\non FDA and EPA’s advice, depending on body weight,\\nsome women should choose seafood lowest in\\nmethylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts\\nin the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern. Additionally,\\ncertain species of seafood (e.g., shark, swordfish, king\\nmackerel) should be avoided during pregnancy. More\\ninformation is available on the FDA or EPA websites at\\nFDA.gov/fishadvice and EPA.gov/fishadvice.\\n\\nAlcoholic Beverages\\n\\nWomen who are or who may be pregnant should not\\ndrink alcohol. However, consumption of alcohol during\\npregnancy continues to be of concern in the United\\nStates. Among women who are pregnant, about 1 in\\n10 reported consuming alcohol during the past month,\\nwith an average intake of 2 or more drink equivalents on\\ndays alcohol is consumed.\\nIt is not safe for women to drink any type or amount of\\nalcohol during pregnancy. Women who drink alcohol\\nand become pregnant should stop drinking immediately\\nand women who are trying to become pregnant should\\n\\nPage 117 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating\\n\\n\\x0cWO M E N W H O A R E P R EG N A N T O R LACTATING\\n\\nFood Safety During\\nPregnancy\\n\\nnot drink at all. Alcohol can harm the baby at any time during pregnancy,\\neven during the first or second month when a woman may not know she\\nis pregnant.\\nNot drinking alcohol also is the safest option for women who are lactating.\\nGenerally, moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages by a woman who\\nis lactating (up to 1 standard drink in a day) is not known to be harmful\\nto the infant, especially if the woman waits at least 2 hours after a single\\ndrink before nursing or expressing breast milk. Additional information\\non breastfeeding and alcohol can be found at: cdc.gov/breastfeeding/\\nbreastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/\\nalcohol.html. Women considering consuming alcohol during lactation\\nshould talk to their healthcare provider.\\n\\nCaffeine\\n\\nMany women consume caffeine during pregnancy or lactation. As discussed\\nin Chapter 1, most intake of caffeine in the United States comes from coffee,\\ntea, and soda. Caffeinated beverages vary widely in their caffeine content.\\nCaffeine passes from the mother to infant in small amounts through breast\\nmilk, but usually does not adversely affect the infant when the mother\\nconsumes low to moderate amounts (about 300 milligrams or less per\\nday, which is about 2 to 3 cups of coffee). More information is available\\nat: cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/dietand-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html. Women who could be or who are\\npregnant should consult their healthcare providers for advice concerning\\ncaffeine consumption.\\n\\nWomen who are pregnant and\\ntheir unborn children are more\\nsusceptible than are the general\\npopulation to the effects of\\nfoodborne illnesses, such as\\nlisteriosis. They need to take\\nspecial care to keep foods\\nsafe and to not eat foods that\\nincrease the risk of foodborne\\nillness. During pregnancy, women\\nshould only eat foods containing\\nseafood, meats, poultry, or\\neggs that have been cooked to\\nrecommended safe minimum\\ninternal temperatures. They also\\nshould take special precautions\\nnot to consume unpasteurized\\n(raw) juice or milk, raw sprouts,\\nor some soft cheeses made from\\nunpasteurized milk. Deli and\\nluncheon meats and hot dogs\\nshould be reheated to steaming\\nhot or 165°F to kill Listeria, the\\nbacteria that causes listeriosis.\\nAdditional food safety resources\\nfor pregnant women are available\\nat fda.gov/media/83740/\\ndownload and foodsafety.gov/\\npeople-at-risk/pregnant-women,\\nand specific answers to food\\nsafety questions are available at\\nfsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/\\ntopics/food-safety-education/\\nget-answers.\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 5: Women Who Are Pregnant or Lactating | Page 118\\n\\n\\x0cWOME N W H O AR E PR EGNANT O R L ACTAT ING\\n\\nPhysical Activity During Pregnancy and Postpartum\\nPREGNANCY\\nPhysical activity during pregnancy can benefit both the mother and the baby. Physical activity increases or\\nmaintains cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces the risk of excessive weight gain and gestational diabetes.\\nFor many benefits, healthy women without contraindications should do a least 150 minutes of moderateintensity aerobic activity a week, as they are able. Women who habitually did vigorous-intensity activity or\\na lot of aerobic or muscle-strengthening physical activity before pregnancy can continue to do so during\\npregnancy. Women can consult their healthcare provider about whether or how to adjust their physical\\nactivity during pregnancy.\\nPOSTPARTUM\\nPhysical activity following the birth of a child continues to benefit a woman’s overall health. Physical activity\\nduring the postpartum period increases cardiorespiratory fitness, improves mood, and reduces the symptoms\\nof postpartum depression. Additionally, physical activity can help achieve and maintain a healthy weight and,\\nwhen combined with caloric restriction, helps promote weight loss.\\nWomen should start slow and build back up to more activity over time. Women should aim for at least 150\\nminutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week.\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the Move\\nYour Way® communications campaign have information about the benefits of physical activity and tips to get\\nstarted.

Furthermore, the dietary choices made\\nduring these life stages can affect women’s health\\nand the health of their children. Supporting women in\\nadopting healthy dietary patterns during this important\\ntime of life and sustaining them thereafter also enables\\nthem to serve as role models when their children begin\\ntransitioning to complementary foods.\\nWomen who are pregnant or lactating face many\\nreal or perceived barriers when trying to meet the\\nrecommendations of the Dietary Guidelines. Constraints\\non time and financial resources, limited access to highquality childcare and family leave policies, as well as\\ninadequate breastfeeding support at home or at work\\nare barriers women may face. These barriers should\\nbe considered by all those who support women in their\\nefforts to follow a healthy dietary pattern.\\nEnsuring women have access to healthy, safe food\\nis vital due to the critical role nutrition plays in health\\npromotion during these life stages. This is particularly\\ncritical for families dealing with food insecurity, which\\nis most prevalent in households with children and\\nin single-parent households. Participation in Federal\\nprograms, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition\\nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC),\\nwhich serves low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and\\nnon-breastfeeding postpartum women, and infants and\\nchildren up to age 5, can help alleviate these challenges\\nand improve dietary intake for many women and\\nchildren facing economic hardship. The Supplemental\\nNutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Food\\nDistribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)\\n\\ncan also serve as resources for low-income women\\nand their families by both supplementing food budgets\\nto support health and by providing nutrition education\\nthrough the SNAP-Ed program. Additionally, USDA’s\\nHealthy Eating on A Budget1 can help women and\\nfamilies plan and prepare healthy, inexpensive meals.\\nOther Government and non-Government resources,\\nsuch as food banks or community meal programs,\\nalso provide food and educational resources that can\\nsupport women in making healthy food choices for\\nthemselves and their families.\\nSupport during lactation can help women meet\\ntheir breastfeeding goals, despite significant\\ndemands on their time and energy during this life\\nstage. Worksite programs and policies that allow\\nwomen adequate time to pump breast milk when\\naway from their child, as well as access to good\\nquality childcare, can allow women who return to\\nwork to achieve breastfeeding goals. Access to\\nbreastfeeding peer counselors, such as those used\\nin WIC, or free breastfeeding support groups through\\nlocal hospitals also can support women during this\\nlife stage. Additionally, health professionals can\\npromote the USDA’s WIC Breastfeeding Support2\\nand the U.S. Department of Health and Human\\nServices Office of Women’s Health (OWH) Your Guide\\nto Breastfeeding3 and their National Breastfeeding\\nHelpline4 (800-994-9662), which are freely accessible\\nto all women.\\nHealth professionals, policymakers, worksite\\nadministrators, community leaders, families,\\nand friends should consider these barriers and\\nopportunities when seeking to support women and\\nfamilies. Developing programs and resources that\\nreduce barriers and create opportunities can help\\nwomen meet their dietary needs and improve their\\noverall health and the health of their children.\\n\\nFor more information on meeting the\\nDietary Guidelines for children during their\\nfirst 2 years of life, see Chapter 2.

Compared to younger\\nadults, older adults are at greater risk of\\nchronic diseases, such as cardiovascular\\ndisease and cancer, as well as health\\nconditions related to changes in bone and\\nmuscle mass, such as osteoporosis and\\nsarcopenia, respectively. An increasing\\nnumber of older adults start this life stage\\nwith excess body weight. Preventing\\nadditional weight gain and achieving a\\nhealthy weight by following a healthy\\ndietary pattern and adopting an active\\nlifestyle can support healthy aging.\\n\\nSelecting healthy food and beverage choices is important for people\\nthroughout this life stage, regardless of their race or ethnicity or their\\ncurrent health status. It is never too late to make improvements. Older\\nadults should follow a healthy dietary pattern because of the changing\\ndietary needs and the heightened risk of malnutrition that occurs with\\nage. Older adults generally have lower calorie needs but similar or even\\nincreased nutrient needs compared to younger adults. The overall nutrient\\ndensity of dietary patterns is particularly important to this age group. Lower\\ncalorie needs result from less physical activity, changes in metabolism,\\nand/or age-related loss in bone and muscle mass. Other factors may affect\\nnutrient needs and absorption of nutrients in older adults, including chronic\\ndisease and conditions, use of multiple medications, and changes in body\\ncomposition. The healthy dietary patterns described below take the unique\\nneeds of older adults into account and are further supported by special\\nconsiderations and strategies for professionals to support healthy aging.\\nPage 123 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 6: Older Adults\\n\\nNutrient-Dense Foods\\nand Beverages\\n\\nNutrient-dense foods and\\nbeverages provide vitamins,\\nminerals, and other healthpromoting components and\\nhave little added sugars,\\nsaturated fat, and sodium.\\nVegetables, fruits, whole\\ngrains, seafood, eggs, beans,\\npeas, and lentils, unsalted nuts\\nand seeds, fat-free and low-fat\\ndairy products, and lean meats\\nand poultry—when prepared\\nwith no or little added sugars,\\nsaturated fat, and sodium—are\\nnutrient-dense foods.\\n\\n\\x0cA D U LT S AG ES 6 0 A ND OLD ER\\n\\nHealthy Dietary\\nPatterns\\nOlder adults are encouraged to follow the\\nrecommendations on the types of foods and beverages\\nthat make up a healthy dietary pattern described in\\nChapter 1.

For adults, the reference man is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The\\nreference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds. Calorie needs vary based on many factors. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare\\nProfessionals, available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator, can be used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, height, weight, and physical\\nactivity level.\\nb Definitions\\n\\nAppendix 3.\\n\\nfor each food group and subgroup and quantity (e.g., cup or ounce equivalents) are provided in Chapter 1 and are compiled in\\n\\nc All foods are assumed to be in nutrient-dense forms; lean or low-fat and prepared with minimal added sugars; refined starches, saturated fat, or\\nsodium. If all food choices to meet food group recommendations are in nutrient-dense forms, a small number of calories remain within the overall\\nlimit of the pattern (i.e., limit on calories for other uses). The number of calories depends on the total calorie level of the pattern and the amounts\\nof food from each food group required to meet nutritional goals. Calories up to the specified limit can be used for added sugars, saturated fat,\\nand/or alcohol, or to eat more than the recommended amount of food in a food group.\\n\\n*NOTE: The total dietary pattern should not exceed Dietary Guidelines limits for added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol; be within the Acceptable\\nMacronutrient Distribution Ranges for protein, carbohydrate, and total fats; and stay within calorie limits.

For example, the nutrients of public concern—\\ncalcium, vitamin D, potassium, and dietary fiber—apply\\nto this age group as well. However, this age group also\\nhas some special nutrition considerations that are\\ndiscussed in the following sections of this chapter. For\\nexample, several additional nutrients are more likely to\\nbe underconsumed during this life stage. These include\\ndietary protein and vitamin B12. Beverage intake,\\nparticularly as it relates to hydration status, also is an\\narea of special consideration.\\n\\nProtein\\n\\nConsuming enough protein is important to prevent the\\nloss of lean muscle mass that occurs naturally with\\nage. Monitoring protein intake is especially important\\nas older adults transition through this life stage. Intake\\npatterns show average intakes of protein foods is\\nlower for individuals ages 71 and older compared to\\nadults ages 60 through 70. About 50 percent of women\\nand 30 percent of men 71 and older fall short of protein\\nfoods recommendations.\\nThe majority of protein in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary\\nPattern is accounted for in the protein foods subgroups:\\nseafood; meats, poultry and eggs; nuts, seeds, and\\nsoy products; and the vegetable subgroup of beans,\\npeas, and lentils, which also is considered a protein\\nfoods subgroup. The dairy and fortified soy alternatives\\nfood group is another source of dietary protein.\\nMost older adults are meeting or exceeding weekly\\nrecommendations for meats, poultry, and eggs, making\\n\\nthis subgroup a common source of protein foods for\\nolder adults (Table 6-1). However, seafood, dairy and\\nfortified soy alternatives, and beans, peas, and lentils are\\nunderconsumed, yet provide important nutrients that\\nsupport healthy dietary patterns. For example, the dairy\\nfood group provides calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin\\nB12 and the beans, peas, and lentils subgroup provides\\ndietary fiber. Many choices within the seafood subgroup\\nalso provide vitamins D and B12 and calcium (if eaten\\nwith bones), and beneficial fatty acids. Food sources\\nof calcium, vitamin D, and dietary fiber are available at\\nDietaryGuidelines.gov.\\nMany older adults can improve their dietary pattern\\nand better meet nutrient needs by choosing from\\na wider variety of protein sources. In some cases,\\nthis may mean using seafood more often in place\\nof meats, poultry, or eggs or using beans, peas, and\\nlentils in mixed dishes, such as soups, rice, or pasta\\ndishes. For others, it may mean maintaining current\\nintakes of protein and finding enjoyable ways to add\\nprotein foods from underconsumed food groups and\\nsubgroups in order to ensure that overall protein needs\\nare met.\\n\\nVitamin B12\\n\\nVitamin B12 is of concern for some older adults because\\nthe ability to absorb this nutrient can decrease with\\nage and use of certain medications can decrease\\nabsorption. Older adults are encouraged to meet the\\nrecommendations for protein foods, a common source\\nof vitamin B12, and include foods fortified with vitamin\\nB12, such as breakfast cereals. Some individuals\\nalso may require vitamin B12 dietary supplements.\\nIndividuals are encouraged to speak with their\\nhealthcare provider to determine what, if any,\\nsupplementation is appropriate.\\n\\nDietary Supplements\\n\\nMany adults in the United States take one or more dietary supplements either as a pill\\nor drink. Popular supplements include some nutrients that are underconsumed among\\nolder adults, including calcium and vitamins D and B12. All sources of a nutrient or food\\ncomponent—whether from food or a dietary supplement—should be considered when\\nassessing an individual’s dietary pattern, including any added sugars that may come from\\nsupplement drinks. Older adults should track and discuss all dietary supplement use with\\ntheir healthcare provider. Beverage supplements should not replace regular food intake\\nunless instructed by a health professional. The National Institutes of Health, Office of\\nDietary Supplements provides the My Dietary Supplement and Medicine Record1, to help\\nindividuals track supplement and medicine use.\\n1 Available\\n\\nat: ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 6: Older Adults | Page 128\\n\\n\\x0cA D ULTS AGES 6 0 AND O L DE R\\n\\nBeverages\\n\\nMany older adults do not drink enough fluids to stay\\nhydrated. One reason for this is that the sensation of\\nthirst tends to decline with age. Concerns about bladder\\ncontrol or issues with mobility also may hinder intake of\\nfluids among older adults. Mean intakes of beverages\\nshow adults ages 60 and older consume significantly\\nfewer fluid ounces across all beverage types compared\\nto adults ages 59 and under—about 2 fewer cups per\\nday, most of which is due to drinking less water.\\nIt is important that older adults drink plenty of water\\nto prevent dehydration and aid in the digestion of\\nfood and absorption of nutrients. In addition to water,\\nchoosing unsweetened beverages such as 100%\\nfruit or vegetable juice and low-fat or fat-free milk\\nor fortified soy beverage can support fluid intake to\\nprevent dehydration while helping to achieve food group\\nrecommendations. The water that is contained in foods,\\nsuch as fruits, vegetables, and soups, contributes to\\nhydration status and is a contributor to total fluid intake.\\nALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES\\nThe Dietary Guidelines do not recommend initiating\\nalcohol consumption for any reason. To help older\\nadults move toward a healthy dietary pattern and\\nminimize risks associated with drinking, older adults\\ncan choose not to drink or drink in moderation—limiting\\nintakes to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink\\nor less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed.\\nOlder adults who choose to drink may experience the\\neffects of alcohol more quickly than they did when they\\nwere younger. This puts older adults at higher risk of\\nfalls, car crashes, and other injuries that may result from\\ndrinking. In addition, older adults tend to have a greater\\nnumber of comorbid health conditions than younger\\nadults, and alcohol use or misuse may adversely affect\\nthe condition or interfere with management of the\\ndisease. Certain older adults should avoid drinking\\nalcohol completely, including those who:\\n• Plan to drive or operate machinery, or participate in\\nactivities that require skill, coordination, and alertness.\\n• Take certain over-the-counter or\\nprescription medications.\\n• Have certain medical conditions.\\n• Are recovering from alcohol use disorder or are\\nunable to control the amount they drink.\\n• More information on alcoholic beverages and their\\nrelationship to health is provided in Chapter 1.\\n\\nSupporting\\nHealthy Eating\\nSimilar to other life stages, older adults can be\\nsupported by professionals, family, and friends to\\nachieve a healthy dietary pattern that accounts for\\nfactors such as cost, preferences, traditions, and\\naccess. Additional factors to consider when supporting\\nhealthy eating for older adults include:\\n• Enjoyment of food: Sharing meals with friends and\\nfamily can help increase food enjoyment and promote\\nadequacy of dietary intake for older adults.\\n• Ability to chew or swallow foods: Experimenting with\\nthe preparation of foods from all food groups can\\nhelp identify textures that are acceptable, appealing,\\nand enjoyable for adults who have difficulties chewing\\nor swallowing. Good dental health is critical to overall\\nhealth, as well as the ability to chew foods properly.\\n• Food safety: Practicing safe food handling\\nprocedures is of particular importance for older\\nadults due to a decline in immune system function\\nthat accompanies age and that increases the risk of\\nfoodborne illness. For more information: Foodsafety.\\ngov for older adults: foodsafety.gov/people-atrisk/older-adults or FDA: fda.gov/media/83744/\\ndownload.\\nOlder adults have access to a variety of Government\\nresources to support a healthy dietary pattern as part\\nof overall healthy aging. Professionals working with\\nolder Americans can use these resources to better\\nsupport access to healthy, safe, and affordable\\nfood choices.\\n• Congregate Nutrition Services: The Older Americans\\nAct authorizes meals and related services in\\ncongregate settings for any person age 60 and older\\nand their spouse of any age. Program sites offer\\nolder individuals healthy meals and opportunities to\\nsocialize. Congregate meals are typically provided\\nin senior centers, schools, churches, or other\\ncommunity settings.\\n• Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\\n(SNAP): Older adults with limited income may qualify\\nfor SNAP, a Federal program that provides temporary\\nbenefits to help individuals purchase foods and\\nbeverages to support a healthy dietary pattern when\\nresources are constrained.\\n\\nPage 129 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 6: Older Adults\\n\\n\\x0cA D U LT S AG ES 6 0 A ND OLD ER\\n\\nPhysical Activity and Older Adults\\n\\nThe benefits of regular physical activity occur throughout life and are essential for healthy\\naging. It is never too late to start being physically active. For older adults, regular physical\\nactivity supports a number of additional health benefits including improved cognition,\\nbalance, and bone strength. These benefits make it easier to perform activities of daily living,\\npreserves function and mobility, and lowers the risk of falls and injuries from falls.\\nAdults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical activity is better\\nthan none. To attain the most health benefits from physical activity, older adults need at least\\n150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. The talk test is a good way\\nto assess moderate intensity for older adults. A person doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity can talk, but not\\nsing. Older adults also need muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days each week. Older adults should incorporate\\nmulticomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the related\\nMove Your Way® resources have information about the benefits of physical activity and tips to get started. Available\\nat health.gov/paguidelines.\\n\\n• Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP):\\nThe CSFP supplements the diets of low-income older\\nadults by providing nutritious USDA packaged food\\nto support a healthy dietary pattern. The CSFP is\\nfederally funded, and private and nonprofit institutions\\nfacilitate the distribution of monthly CSFP packages\\nto eligible older adults.\\n• Home-Delivered Nutrition Services: The Older\\nAmericans Act authorizes meals and related services\\nin a person’s home for individuals ages 60 and\\nolder and their spouse of any age. Older adults who\\nexperience difficulty leaving the home due to frailty,\\nhealth concerns, or certain medical conditions may\\nbenefit from home-delivered meals offered under the\\nOlder Americans Act.\\n• Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP):\\nThe CACFP is a Federal program that provides\\nreimbursements for nutritious meals and snacks\\nto older adults enrolled in daycare facilities. Older\\nadults receiving care at nonresidential care centers\\nmay receive meals and snacks that meet nutrition\\nstandards of the CACFP.\\nAdditional resources to support older adults exist at\\nthe community level. For example, the Senior Farmers\\nMarket Nutrition Program (SFMNP) provides many\\nlow-income seniors with access to fruits and vegetables\\ngrown in their local communities. SNAP Education\\n(SNAP-Ed) programming may also be offered and\\n\\nteach older adults cooking and shopping skills.\\nIndividuals working within these settings must ensure\\nthe availability of nutrient-dense foods and assist older\\nadults in choosing a healthy dietary pattern that fits in\\ntheir cultural and food preferences.\\n\\nHealthy Eating\\nThrough the Lifespan\\nThis chapter has focused on the unique nutritional\\nconsiderations of the older adult life stage. It also has\\nreinforced the idea that the core elements of a healthy\\ndietary pattern are remarkably consistent across the\\nlifespan and across health outcomes. More than that, a\\nhealthy dietary pattern is flexible—people can customize\\nthe Dietary Guidelines recommendations to suit their\\npersonal preferences, cultural traditions, and budget\\nconsiderations.\\nBeginning at the earliest life stage—infancy and\\ntoddlerhood—a healthy dietary pattern can help people\\nachieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk\\nof chronic diseases. However, it is never too late to\\nmake improvements. People at any stage of life can\\nbenefit by changing to nutrient-dense forms of foods\\nand beverages across all food groups, in recommended\\namounts, and within calorie limits. The bottom line:\\nFor lifelong good health, make every bite count with\\nthe Dietary Guidelines for Americans!\\n\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Chapter 6: Older Adults | Page 130\\n\\n\\x0cAppendix 1:\\nNutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups\\na\\n\\nTable A1-1\\nDaily Nutritional Goals, Ages 6 Through 11 Months and 12 Through 23 Months\\nNutrient\\n\\n6 Through 11 Months\\n\\n12 Through 23 Months\\n\\nGoal\\n\\nSource of Goalb\\n\\nGoal\\n\\nSource of Goalb\\n\\nProtein (g)\\n\\n11\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n13\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nCarbohydrate (g)\\n\\n95\\n\\nAI\\n\\n130\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nFiber, total dietary (g)\\n\\nn/ad\\n\\nn/ad\\n\\n19\\n\\nAI\\n\\nTotal lipid (% kcal)\\n\\nn/ad\\n\\nn/ad\\n\\n30-40\\n\\nAMDR\\n\\n18:2 Linoleic acid (g)\\n\\n4.6\\n\\nAI\\n\\n7\\n\\nAI\\n\\n18:3 Linolenic acid (g)\\n\\n0.5\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.7\\n\\nAI\\n\\nCalcium (mg)\\n\\n260\\n\\nAI\\n\\n700\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nIron (mg)\\n\\n11\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n7\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nMagnesium (mg)\\n\\n75\\n\\nAI\\n\\n80\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nPhosphorus (mg)\\n\\n275\\n\\nAI\\n\\n460\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nPotassium (mg)\\n\\n860\\n\\nAI\\n\\n2,000\\n\\nAI\\n\\nSodium (mg)\\n\\n370\\n\\nAI\\n\\n1,200\\n\\nCDRR\\n\\n3\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n3\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n500\\n\\nAI\\n\\n300\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n5\\n\\nAI\\n\\n6\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nVitamin D (IUc)\\n\\n400\\n\\nAI\\n\\n600\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nVitamin C (mg)\\n\\n50\\n\\nAI\\n\\n15\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nThiamin (mg)\\n\\n0.3\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.5\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nRiboflavin (mg)\\n\\n0.4\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.5\\n\\nRDA\\n\\n4\\n\\nAI\\n\\n6\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nMinerals\\n\\nZinc (mg)\\nVitamins\\nVitamin A (mcg RAEc)\\nVitamin E (mg ATc)\\n\\nNiacin (mg)\\n\\nPage 131 | Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Appendix 1\\n\\n\\x0cTable A1-1 (continued)\\nDaily Nutritional Goals, Ages 6 Through 11 Months and 12 Through 23 Months\\nNutrient\\n\\n6 Through 11 Months\\n\\n12 Through 23 Months\\n\\nGoal\\n\\nSource of Goalb\\n\\nGoal\\n\\nSource of Goalb\\n\\nVitamin B-6 (mg)\\n\\n0.3\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.5\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nVitamin B-12 (mcg)\\n\\n0.5\\n\\nAI\\n\\n0.9\\n\\nRDA\\n\\nCholine (mg)\\n\\n150\\n\\nAI\\n\\n200\\n\\nAI\\n\\nVitamin K (mcg)\\n\\n2.5\\n\\nAI\\n\\n30\\n\\nAI\\n\\nFolate (mcg DFEc)\\n\\n80\\n\\nAI\\n\\n150\\n\\nRDA\\n\\na\\n\\nGoals reflect Dietary Reference Intakes developed for 7 to 12 months or 6 to 12 months applied to ages 6 to 12 months and DRIs for 1 to 3 years\\napplied to 12 to 24 months.\\n\\nb\\n\\nAI = Adequate Intake, CDRR = Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Level, RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance.\\n\\nc\\n\\nAT = alpha-tocopherol, DFE = Dietary Folate Equivalent, IU = International Units, RAE = Retinol Activity Equivalents.\\n\\nd\\n\\nn/a = not applicable to this age group.\\n\\nSources: Institute of Medicine.

In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight, and other factors affect how many\\ncalories should be consumed. Estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain energy balance for various age\\nand sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in Table A2-1 for toddlers ages 12 through\\n23 months and Table A2-2 for ages 2 and older. These estimates are based on the Estimated Energy Requirements\\n(EER) equations, using reference heights (average) and reference weights (healthy) for each age-sex group. For\\ntoddlers, children, and adolescents, reference height and weight vary by age. For adults, the reference man is 5 feet\\n10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds.\\nEstimates range from 700 to 1,000 calories for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months. Estimated needs for young\\nchildren ages 2 through 8 range from 1,000 to 2,000 calories. A wider range of 1,400 to 3,200 calories is estimated\\nfor older children and adolescents, with males generally having higher calorie needs than females.\\nAdult estimated calorie needs range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for females and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per\\nday for males. As shown, males generally require more calories than females. Due to reductions in basal metabolic\\nrate that occur with aging, calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age.\\nEstimated calorie needs during the first trimester of pregnancy generally do not increase compared to prepregnancy\\nneeds. Additional calories needed for the later trimesters of pregnancy and during lactation are outlined in Table\\nA2-3 and include approximately 300 to 400 additional calories. It is recommended that women follow their\\nhealthcare provider’s guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy as many factors, including\\nprepregnancy weight status, gestational weight gain, and multiple pregnancies, may affect calorie needs. Women\\nwith overweight or obesity have lower recommended gestational weight gain during pregnancy, which may affect\\ncalorie needs.\\nThese calorie needs are only estimates, and approximations of individual calorie needs can be determined\\nwith online tools. The DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals, available at nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator, can\\nbe used to estimate calorie needs based on age, sex, height, weight, activity level, and pregnancy or lactation status.\\n\\nTable A2-1\\nEstimated Calorie Needs per Day, by Age and Sex, Ages 12 Through 23 Months\\nAGE IN MONTHS\\n\\nMales\\n\\nFemales\\n\\n12\\n\\n800\\n\\n800\\n\\n15\\n\\n900\\n\\n800\\n\\n18\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n900\\n\\n21 through 23\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,000\\n\\nSource: Institute of Medicine.

The Healthy Vegetarian Dietary\\nPattern (Tables A3-3 and A3-4) and the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern (Table A3-5) are variations\\nthat also exemplify a healthy dietary pattern. For the first time, the Healthy U.S.-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Dietary\\nPatterns are provided for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving human milk or infant\\nformula. These patterns are designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while\\nstaying within limits for overconsumed dietary components, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.\\nThe methodology used to develop and update these Patterns builds on the rich history USDA has in developing food\\nguides. This methodology includes using current food consumption data to determine the mix and proportions of\\nfoods to include in each group. Food composition data is used to select a nutrient-dense representative for each\\nfood and calculate nutrient profiles for each food group. As would be expected, most foods in their nutrient-dense\\nforms do contain some sodium and saturated fat. In a few cases, such as in the case of whole-wheat bread, the\\nmost appropriate representative in current Federal databases contains a small amount of added sugars. Detailed\\ninformation about the representative foods, nutrient profiles, and patterns is available in the online appendix of the\\nScientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.1\\nAmounts of each food group and subgroup within the patterns are based on nutrient and Dietary Guidelines\\nstandards (see Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for Age-Sex Groups). Standards for nutrient adequacy aim to meet the\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), which are designed to cover the needs of 97 percent of the population,\\nand Adequate Intakes (AI), which are used when an average nutrient requirement cannot be determined. The\\nPatterns meet these standards for almost all nutrients. For a few nutrients (vitamin D and vitamin E for all ages, and\\ncholine for ages 2 and older), amounts in the Patterns are marginal or below the RDA or AI standard for many or all\\nage/sex groups. In most cases, an intake of these nutrients below the RDA or AI is not considered to be of public\\nhealth concern. For more information on dietary components of public health concern, see Chapter 1.\\nThe Patterns have 12 calorie levels to meet the needs of individuals across the lifespan ages 2 and older. For\\ntoddlers ages 12 through 23 months, who are no longer receiving either human milk or infant formula, the Patterns\\nare provided at 4 calorie levels. Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe healthy dietary patterns and relevant calorie levels\\nfor each life stage. To follow these Patterns, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each\\ngroup and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so\\nthat the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.\\n\\n1Available\\n\\nat: dietaryguidelines.gov/2020-advisory-committee-report/food-pattern-modeling\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025 | Appendix 3 | Page 142\\n\\n\\x0cTable A3-1\\nHealthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern for Toddlers Ages 12 Through 23 Months Who Are No Longer\\nReceiving Human Milk or Infant Formula, With Daily or Weekly Amounts From Food Groups, Subgroups,\\nand Components\\nCALORIE LEVEL OF\\nPATTERNa\\n\\n700\\n\\n900\\n\\n1,000\\n\\nDaily Amount of Food From Each Groupd\\n(Vegetable and protein foods subgroup amounts are per week.)\\n\\nFOOD GROUP OR SUBGROUPb,c\\nVegetables (cup eq/day)\\n\\n800\\n\\n⅔\\n\\n¾\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\nVegetable Subgroups in Weekly Amounts\\nDark-Green Vegetables\\n(cup eq/wk)\\n\\n1\\n\\n⅓\\n\\n½\\n\\n½\\n\\nRed and Orange Vegetables\\n(cup eq/wk)\\n\\n1\\n\\n1¾\\n\\n2½\\n\\n2½\\n\\nBeans, Peas, Lentils\\n(cup eq/wk)\\n\\n¾\\n\\n⅓\\n\\n½\\n\\n½\\n\\nStarchy Vegetables\\n(cup eq/wk)\\n\\n1\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\nOther Vegetables (cup eq/wk)\\n\\n¾\\n\\n1¼\\n\\n1½\\n\\n1½\\n\\n½\\n\\n¾\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n1¾\\n\\n2¼\\n\\n2½\\n\\n3\\n\\nWhole Grains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n1½\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\nRefined Grains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\n¼\\n\\n¼\\n\\n½\\n\\n1\\n\\n1⅔\\n\\n1¾\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\nFruits (cup eq/day)\\nGrains (ounce eq/day)\\n\\nDairy (cup eq/day)\\nProtein Foods (ounce eq/day)\\n\\nProtein Foods Subgroups in Weekly Amounts\\nMeats, Poultry\\n(ounce eq/wk)\\nEggs (ounce eq/wk)\\nSeafood (ounce eq/wk)e\\nNuts, Seeds, Soy Products\\n(ounce eq/wk)\\nOils (grams/day)\\n\\n8¾\\n\\n7\\n\\n7\\n\\n7¾\\n\\n2\\n\\n2¾\\n\\n2¼\\n\\n2¼\\n\\n2-3\\n\\n2-3\\n\\n2-3\\n\\n2-3\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n1¼\\n\\n1¼\\n\\n9\\n\\n9\\n\\n8\\n\\n13\\n\\na Calorie level ranges: Energy levels are calculated based on median\\n\\nlength and body weight reference individuals.

Deficiency is common, especially\\nin women who have darker skin, spend most of their\\ntime indoors or cover most of their body in clothing.\\nDeficiency can cause bone weakness and muscle\\npain in women and skeletal abnormalities in babies.\\nWomen at risk should get their vitamin D level checked\\nand if low a supplement will be needed. Their breastfed\\nbabies will also need a vitamin D supplement suitable for\\ninfants and children.\\n\\n»» contains all the nutrients and growth factors needed\\nfor your baby’s growth and development for the first\\nfew months of life\\n»» is specially adapted to your baby’s immature\\ndigestive system\\n»» helps to protect your baby against infection, diarrhoea\\nand allergies\\n»» is economical and already at the right temperature.\\nJust as your baby’s nutrition is important, so is your own\\ndiet. Eating well during breastfeeding will help you meet\\nyour need for extra nutrients as well as cope with the\\nphysical demands of caring for a new baby. Try to make\\ntime in your busy schedule to eat regular, varied meals.\\nSee the Healthy Foods Guide and Sample Meals Plans\\nat the end of this fact sheet for information on what foods\\nto include in your daily diet and how to incorporate the\\nrecommended daily serves into your everyday meals.\\n\\nImportant nutrients during breastfeeding\\nProtein\\nBreast milk contains protein to meet your baby’s growth\\nneeds. Good sources of protein for breastfeeding mothers\\ninclude meat, chicken, eggs, cheese, yoghurt and\\nvegetarian choices such as nuts, tofu and legumes (lentils,\\nbaked beans, split peas, etc.).\\n\\nCalcium\\nCalcium is needed to maintain bone strength. The best\\nsources of calcium are dairy foods. Fish with edible bones,\\nsuch as canned salmon and sardines, are also a good\\nsource. There are small amounts of calcium in other foods,\\nbut on average about three-quarters of our calcium comes\\nfrom dairy foods. If you drink soy or other milks such as\\nalmond or rice milk, check the label and choose a brand\\nwith the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk (at least\\n100mg per 100ml). Low fat dairy foods are not lower in\\ncalcium than the full fat versions.\\nGOOD NUTRITION FOR BREASTFEEDING D14-158 - APRIL 2021\\n\\nIron\\nPregnancy can use up your iron stores so it is important\\nto replenish these when breastfeeding. The richest\\nsources of iron are liver, meat, chicken and fish. Iron\\nis also present in legumes as well as whole grains,\\nbreakfast cereals, green leafy vegetables and Milo\\nand Ovaltine.\\nWomen who were diagnosed with iron deficiency\\nin pregnancy should consult their doctor about whether\\nto continue taking iron tablets after pregnancy to rebuild\\ntheir iron stores.\\n\\nIodine\\nIodine is needed for the normal brain development\\nof the baby. It can be difficult to get enough iodine\\nfrom the Australian food supply. Seafood, dairy\\nfoods and iodine added to bread flour help meet the\\nneeds of most of the population but this may not be\\nenough for breastfeeding women. If you are\\nbreastfeeding an extra 150 micrograms (mcg or µg)\\na day is recommended. This level is present in most\\nbreastfeeding multivitamins. If you regularly use salt\\nin cooking or at table, changing to iodised salt is another\\nway of increasing iodine intake.\\n\\nPAGE 1 OF 5\\n\\n\\x0cwww.thewomens.org.au\\nFluids\\n\\nRegaining your shape\\n\\nYou will need plenty of fluids during breastfeeding to\\nreplace the fluid used in breast milk. You may find you\\nare thirstier so just drink to satisfy your thirst, usually at\\nleast eight cups per day. All fluids count but water is a\\nbetter choice than sugary drinks such as fruit juice, soft\\ndrink or cordial which may reduce your appetite for more\\nnourishing foods and will not help if you are watching\\nyour weight.\\n\\nBreastfeeding is an energetic process! Most women\\nwill need more kilojoules (calories) than they did\\nduring pregnancy.\\n\\nVegetarian eating during breastfeeding\\nA vegetarian diet can meet nutritional needs when\\nbreastfeeding if care is taken to include adequate\\nprotein, iron, vitamin B12 and calcium-containing foods.\\nNuts, seeds and legumes (dried beans and lentils)\\nand food derived from them, such as tofu and hummus,\\nare good sources of protein and iron (see the chart\\nfor serve sizes). Iron is not as well absorbed from\\nthese foods as it is from meat so vegetarians also need\\nto eat other iron-containing foods such as wholegrain\\ncereals, iron-enriched breakfast cereals, wholegrain\\nbreads and green leafy vegetables. Milo and Ovaltine\\nare also sources of iron. Vitamin C, which is present in\\nmany fruits and vegetables, helps absorption of iron\\nfrom these foods if eaten in the same meal or snack.\\nIf you do not consume dairy foods you will need either\\ncalcium-fortified soy or other milk or a calcium supplement.\\nVegans and vegetarians who eat few dairy foods or eggs\\nare at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency as this vitamin is\\nnaturally present only in foods of animal origin. It is added\\nto certain brands of soy milk and meat substitutes but the\\namount in these foods may not be enough if few other\\nsources of B12 are eaten.\\nB12 is needed for blood cell, nerve and brain development\\nof the baby. Pregnancy and breastfeeding can rapidly\\ndeplete body stores. Breastfed babies of vegan mothers\\nare particularly at risk of B12 deficiency. Women at risk\\nshould have their level checked and may need to take a\\nsupplement. If you are concerned please discuss this with\\nyour dietitian or doctor.\\n\\nSome of the extra energy can be provided by the fat\\nstores your body laid down during pregnancy. Use your\\nweight and appetite as a guide to your energy needs.\\nSome women find that they need to eat more to satisfy\\nan increase in their appetite or to prevent rapid weight loss.\\nIf necessary include extra snacks such as sandwiches,\\nmilk drinks, fruit, nuts, yoghurt, cereal and milk, cheese\\nand crackers.\\nOther women have more trouble getting back to their\\npre-pregnant weight. If you have gained extra weight\\nduring pregnancy, breastfeeding may help you to lose\\nsome weight, but watching what you eat is also important.\\nAim for a slow steady weight loss over several months.\\nStrict dieting or skipping meals is not recommended as\\nyou will not be able to meet your nutrient needs. However,\\ntry to keep the high fat, high sugar foods to a minimum and\\ninclude some regular exercise. Here are some suggestions\\nthat may help.\\n»» Limit high fat foods such as greasy take-away, pastries,\\nbattered or crumbed foods, chips, crisps, rich desserts,\\nchocolate, ice-cream and sweet biscuits.\\n»» Grilling, steaming, baking, poaching and casseroling are\\ngood low fat ways of cooking lean meat, fish or chicken.\\n»» Use butter or margarine sparingly.\\n»» Use low fat dairy products such as low fat milk, low fat\\nyoghurt and reduced fat cheeses.\\n»» Although sugar has fewer kilojoules than fats, large\\namounts add up. Sweet drinks such as soft drinks,\\ncordials and juices have between 4 to 14 teaspoons or\\nsugar per drink.\\n»» Plan and shop so that you have the ingredients for\\nhealthy meals and snacks on hand.\\n\\nExercise\\nRegular exercise will help you regain your shape and\\nis also important for general wellbeing. Walking is a safe\\n‘fat burning’ activity and probably the most convenient\\nwhile your baby is still in a pram. Aim for a 30 minute walk\\nmost days.\\n\\nGOOD NUTRITION FOR BREASTFEEDING D14-158 - APRIL 2021\\n\\nPAGE 2 OF 5\\n\\n\\x0cwww.thewomens.org.au\\nFrequently asked questions\\nWill certain foods cause allergy or colic?\\nEverything in moderation is a good rule. There is no\\nscientific basis to suggest that some foods cause gas,\\nwind or colic in babies. No specific food has been proven\\nto upset babies so mothers need not avoid foods unless\\nthey continually cause problems, for example, rashes,\\nstomach discomfort or diarrhoea in your baby.\\nAt present there is no evidence to suggest that avoiding\\ncertain foods during breastfeeding will reduce the risk of\\nthe child developing an allergy, even if there is a family\\nhistory of allergy. For more information on this speak to\\nyour doctor, dietitian or maternal and child health nurse.\\nIf you wish to avoid foods while breastfeeding for any\\nreason, you may need expert guidance to prevent\\nnutritional imbalances.\\n\\nCan I drink coffee?\\nA small amount of caffeine from coffee, tea, cola and\\nenergy drinks enters the breast milk. Most women\\ncan drink moderate amounts of caffeinated drinks\\nwithout affecting the baby. However some babies,\\nespecially newborns, are sensitive to even small\\namounts of caffeine and it may contribute to irritability\\nor sleeplessness. Large amounts of caffeine may also\\ninhibit the milk let-down reflex.\\n\\nCan I drink alcohol?\\nAlcohol passes into the breast milk. It reduces the\\namount of breast milk the baby drinks, disrupts the\\nbaby’s sleep pattern and may affect the baby’s\\ndevelopment. Not drinking is the safest choice.\\nIf you choose to drink alcohol it is best avoided during\\nthe first month while breastfeeding and sleep patterns\\nare being established. After that, (if you do drink),\\nlimit to 1 to 2 standard drinks, but don’t drink every day\\nand don’t drink just before breastfeeding. Because\\nalcohol passes quickly into breast milk it is best to drink\\njust after breastfeeding then wait 2 to 3 hours for the level\\nto fall before feeding again.\\n\\nDo I still need to avoid foods that may\\ncontain listeria?\\nNo, breastfeeding is not considered to be a high risk\\nfor listeria infection so you can enjoy any favorite foods\\nyou’ve been missing.\\n\\nGOOD NUTRITION FOR BREASTFEEDING D14-158 - APRIL 2021\\n\\nAre herbal and traditional medicines safe\\nto take while breastfeeding?\\nSome herbal preparations pass through the breast\\nmilk to the baby and may be harmful. Check with\\na health care professional before taking these\\npreparations. More information is available in our fact\\nsheet Herbal and traditional medicines in breastfeeding.\\n\\nHow long can I breastfeed my baby?\\nBreast milk alone provides all the nutrients needed for\\ngrowth and development of your baby for around the\\nfirst six months. After this gradually introduce solids until\\nyour baby is eating a full balanced diet. Breast milk will\\ncontinue to be an important part of your baby’s diet for\\nat least the first year of life.

Nutrient profile of breastmilk is minimally affected by the mother’s diet by giving priority to protection of infant; protein,\\nfat, carbohydrates and folate are sufficient in breastmilk even if they lack in the mother’s diet. However, this may be harmful for mothers\\nbecause of consequent shortage of nutrient storages. On the other hand, some nutrients such as vitamin A, thiamin, and riboflavin are\\ndependent on the diet of the mother; if they are insufficient in the mother’s diet, so are they in breastmilk and in the infant. Micronutrient\\ninsufficiency is an important health problem in Turkish mothers. In that context, the importance of a balanced diet in lactating mothers\\nfor both their own healths and ideal breastmilk content should be emphasized. Making projects about this issue should be a priority for\\ncountries where micronutrient insufficiency is frequent. (Turk Arch Ped 2013; 48: 183-187)\\nKey words: Breastmilk, infant, nursing mother, nutrition\\n\\nIntroduction\\nA balanced diet for lactating mothers is essential\\nfor providing physiological needs of the mother and for\\nbalancing the nutritional reserve and for healthy growth\\nand development of the infant via ideal breastmilk amount\\nand content. During this period when the highest nutritional\\nrequirements are experienced, the organism of the mother\\nis equipped with accommodation mechanisms to protect\\nboth her own health and the infant’s health. Due to these\\naccommodations the deficiency in the mother’s diet is\\nreflected at the lowest level in the infant. It is sure that\\neach accommodation has its limits and therefore nutritional\\ndeficiencies may lead to problems in the infant in the shortterm or long-term. In this balance, the loser is primarily the\\nmother. Only if the mother has malnutrition or if there is an\\nadolescent pregnancy which has a nonignorable frequency\\n(5,9%) in our country, the nutrients are used in the mother\\nand the infant may be harmed (1,2,3).\\n\\nThe favorable effects of breastmilk on the health of\\ninfants and adults is being understood better every passing\\nday. Therefore, community-scale efforts should be made\\nfor a more successful breastfeeding period. The health of\\nthe infant achieved by increasing the amount of breastmilk\\nand a more ideal breastmilk content are emphasized, but\\nthe health of the mother is ignored.\\nThe effect of the mother’s diet on the amount of\\nbreastmilk\\nIt is known that nutrition of the mother with a non-ideal\\nand even a poor diet does not interfere with breastfeeding\\n(4). If the mother does not have a severe malnutrition, the\\neffect of the nutritional status on the amount of breastmilk\\nis negligible (2). Excessive energy is needed for the nursing\\nmother to produce milk. To provide this excessive energy,\\ngenerally the amount of eating of the mother is increased,\\nbut even if it is not increased, suıfficient milk can be\\nproduced (5). In this case, the fat stores of the mother are\\nused as energy source and the mother loses weight. In\\n\\nAd\\xaddress for Cor\\xadres\\xadpon\\xadden\\xadce: Mukadder Ayşe Selimoğlu MD, İnönü University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatrics, Malatya, Turkey\\nE-mail: ayseselimoglu@hotmail.com Re\\xadcei\\xadved: 22.01.2013 Ac\\xadcep\\xadted: 26.02.2013\\nTurkish Archives of Pediatrics, published by Galenos Publishing\\n\\n\\x0c184\\n\\nMukadder Ayşe Selimoğlu\\nNutrition in lactating mothers\\n\\nhealthy mothers, 800 g/month weight loss is observed in\\nthe first 6 months after delivery. In mothers with malnutrition,\\n100 g/month weight loss is observed (6). It is not healthy to\\nlose more than 2 kg/month during the lactation period (2).\\nThe amount of energy taken and the amount of milk\\nproduced are not directly related. The amount of breastmilk\\nshows sufficient sucking of the infant rather than the milk\\nproduction capacity of the mother. Thus, if the nursing\\ntechnique is accurate and the infant is sucking in a healthy\\nand willing way, the milk production is sufficient (7,8).\\nExcept for excessive limitation of energy, the energy\\namount of the diet does not affect the amount of breastmilk\\n(4). The amount of breastmilk in mothers with malnutrition\\nmay be lower. This may be related with the amount of\\nenergy taken or insufficient sucking of the low birth weight\\ninfant (4). Studies show that the amount of milk decreases,\\nif the daily energy intake of the mother is lower than 1800\\nkcal (9).\\nIt was shown that energy support did not increase the\\namount of breastmilk, but mothers with malnutrition could\\nmaintain their stores and nurse longer when supplements\\nwere given (2,10,11).\\n\\nThe effects of the mother’s diet on the content\\nof breastmilk and on the mother\\nEnergy:\\nThere are studies which have shown that the content\\nof breastmilk (density) is related with the body structure\\nof the mother or weigth gain during pregnancy (12,13,14).\\nRestrictive diets lead to a decrease in the energy intensity\\nin breastmilk especially in mothers with malnutrition, but\\nchanging the amount of energy in the diet does not lead\\nto a change in the content of breastmilk in mothers with a\\nnormal body weight (2).\\nThe amount of excess energy required by a nursing\\nmother is approximately 750 kcal/day. The mother meets\\n500 calories of this from her diet and the remaining\\n250 calories are met from the fat stores gained during\\npregnancy. Thus, the mother can lose 5 kg in 6 months\\nafter delivery. However, it is not recommended that nursing\\nmothers lose weight in a short time (>0.5 kg/week) (2).\\nProtein:\\nThe effect of low-protein diet on breastmilk in nursing\\nmothers is not clear. There are publications reporting that\\nthe protein content of breastmilk in mothers with malnutrition\\nis not low or not different from normal (2,4). There are also\\npublications indicating that protein support leads to a small\\nincrease in the protein amount of breastmilk, does not lead\\nto any change or increases the amount of breastmilk without\\naffecting the content (2,4,15,16). Protein requirement is\\nhigh in nursing mothers. One should be more careful in\\nvegetarian mothers.\\n\\nTurk Arch Ped 2013; 183-187\\n\\nFat:\\nLong chain fatty acids (LCPUFA) are essential nutrients\\nfor development of the normal brain development in\\ninfants. The factors which affect LCPUFA synthesis in the\\nmother include intake of trans fatty acids, deficiency of\\niron, magnesium, zinc, calcium, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and\\nB12 and protein-poor and sucrose-rich diets (2). Thus, the\\nmother should eat healthyly and deficiencies of vitamins\\nand minerals should be absent for an ideal LCPUFA status.\\nIt is known that fat intake in nursing mothers may\\nchange the content of breastmilk (2,4). The proportion of\\nfat in breastmilk is related with the body structure of the\\nmother and weight gain and diet intake during pregnancy.\\nWith very-low-fat diets the proportion of fat in breastmilk\\ndecreases, but the infant can take sufficient energy from\\nbreastmilk, if he/she sucks adequately (2). In addition, the\\ndeficit can be closed by synthesis of medium-chain-fatty\\nacids in the breast, if the mother has adequate energy\\nintake despite low-fat diet. If both energy and fat intake is\\nlow, the composition of fatty acids in breastmilk reflects the\\nfat stores of the mother (17).\\nIn the breastmilk of vegetarian mothers, the level of\\nlineloic acid is higher and the level of docosahexaenoic acid\\n(DHA) is lower. The level of DHA is higher in the breastmilk\\nof mothers who consume fish (18). Sine a significant\\namount of LCPUFA is transferred to the breastmilk, nursing\\nmothers’ requirement is high (2).\\nMinerals and vitamins:\\nIn a nursing mother with iron deficiency, the risk for\\ndisease is increased and the success of nursing may be\\ndecreased because of reasons including weakness and\\nfatigue. Iron requirement which is increased during lactation\\nin healthy mothers is compensated by lack of mensturation\\nand increased absorption during lactation. The factors\\nwhich lead to development of iron deficiency during\\nlactation include iron status before pregnancy, hemorrhage\\nafter delivery, vegetarianism, low-vitamin C diet, excessive\\ntea consumption, frequent pregnancies, early pregnancy\\nand low socioeconomical status (2,4).\\nThe amount of calcium in breastmilk is determined\\nby increased bone absorption and not by the amount in\\nthe mother’s diet (19). It was shown that the content of\\nbreastmilk and bone mineralization of the infant did not\\nchange in mothers who were given calcium supplements\\n(19). Thus, the amount of calcium in breastmilk is\\nindependent of the diet. Estrogen which decreases during\\nlactation provides sufficient calcium by increasing bone\\nabsorption. Since the highest bone mass is achieved at the\\nage of 18-20 years, the requirement in adolescent mothers\\nis higher (2).\\nThe requirement of zinc is increased during lactation.\\nZinc which is released because of reduced uterus and\\nreduced blood supply supports the stores in the mother\\n\\n\\x0cTurk Arch Ped 2013; 183-187\\n\\nin the first month of lactation (20). It has been reported\\nthat external zinc supplements do not change the amount\\nin breastmilk and the amount of zinc in breastmilk is not\\naffected by low intake (21).\\nMagnesium is an essential mineral for energy production\\nand bone tissue. The amount in breastmilk is not affected\\nby the diet and there is no evidence that the requirement is\\nincreased during lactation (2).\\nIodine is essential for thyroid metabolism. The amount\\nin earth and soil affects the amount in the diet. The\\nrequirement increases during lactation and the amount in\\nbreastmilk is directly related with the intake of the mother.\\nThe amount in breastmilk is decreased in areas of iodine\\ndeficiency (2,4).\\nThe requirement for vitamin A in nursing mothers is\\nincreased and the amount in breastmilk is affected by\\nthe diet. When there is deficiecy in the mother, the infant\\nis affected directly (2). The level of vitamin A is lower in\\nlow-income families in developing countries compared to\\nfamilies in developed countries. Vitamin A supplements in\\nthese mothers increase the level in breastmilk (22).\\nThe group of mothers and thus infants carrying a risk in\\nterms of vitamin D deficiency is constituted of mothers who are\\ndependent to home, dark-skinned and veiled and their infants\\nand the uneducated group with a lower socioeconomical\\nstatus. Normally, the requirement in pregnancy and lactation\\nis not different from other periods (2).\\nDuring lactation, 4 mg vitamin E is trasferred to\\nbreastmilk daily; this is the increase in the requirement (2).\\nIncreasing vitamin K in the mother’s diet does not\\nprotect the infant from hemorrhagic disease (2).\\nThe requirement of folic acid is increased during\\nlactation. When there is deficiency of folic acid, the amount\\nin breastmilk is maintained, but the mother is harmed (2).\\nDuring lactation, the requirement of thiamin is increased.\\nThe amount in breastmilk reflects the intake in the diet.\\nSimilarly, the amounts of riboflavin, niacin and vitamin\\nB6 reflect intake. Riboflavin deficiency may be observed\\nespecially in individuals who do not consume milk. Infants\\nare dependent on the diet of the mother in terms of vitamin\\nB12 and one should pay special attention to vegetarian\\nmothers (2).\\nVitamin C in breastmilk is also affected by the diet of\\nthe mother (2).\\nThe nutritional status of mothers in Turkey\\nAccording to the Turkey Demographic and Health\\nsurveys (2008) 1.8 % of our women were found to\\nhave malnutrition (BMI<18.5), 34.3% were found to be\\noverweight (BMI = 25-30) and 22.7% were found to be\\nobese (BMI>30) when evaluated in terms of body mass\\nindex (BMI) (3). Thus, energy deficiency is not a significant\\nproblem in Turkish women.\\n\\nMukadder Ayşe Selimoğlu\\nNutrition in lactating mothers\\n\\n185\\n\\nAlthough protein consumption per capita seems to be\\nadequate in our country, it is observed that its distribution is\\nproblematic (rural and urban) and intake of animal protein\\nis low (23). Similarly, intake of calcium, vitamin A and\\nriboflavin is lower than the recommended levels (23).\\nIn studies conducted with adolescents, deficiency\\nwas considered as a level lower than 67% of the daily\\nrecommended amount and it was shown that energy\\nwas consumed lower by 20-43%, protein was consumed\\nlower by 8-24%, vitamin A was consumed lower by 3259%, riboflavin was consumed lower by 30-70%, iron was\\nconsumed lower by 28-70% and calcium was consumed\\nlower by 16-39% (23). According to population cencus\\nstatistics 5.9% of the deliveries in 2001 were constituted of\\nadolescent pregnancies (15-19 years) (3). This creates the\\nconcern that micronutrient deficiencies during this period\\nwould be more exaggerated in terms of both the infant and\\nthe mother.\\nIn studies conducted with pregnant women, it was shown\\nthat intake of energy, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A, tiamin\\nand riboflavin was lower than 67% of the recommended daily\\nintake (23). When the prenatal and postnatal periods were\\nevaluated, it was reported that nutrients were taken deficiently\\nexcept for energy, protein and vitamin E and C (23).\\nIn a study conducted with nursing mothers, it was shown\\nthat mothers were at risk of iron deficiency (39%), riboflavin\\ndeficiency (43%), vitamin B6 deficiency (36%), vitamin B12\\n(60%) and folic acid deficiency (73%) (23).\\nIt is known that 50% of pregnant and nursing mothers\\nin Turkey have iron deficiency (23,24,25). In a study\\nperformed in 823 pregnant women in the province of\\nMalatya in 2010, the frequency of anemia was found to be\\n27%. Iron deficiency was found in 50% of these, vitamin\\nB12 deficiency was found in 35% and folate deficiency was\\nfound in 72% (26).\\nIn a study performed in Manisa and İzmir in 2008 (27),\\nvitamin A and E deficiencies were not found in mothers\\nliving in these provinces, but plasma vitamin A level\\nwas found to be low in 46% of pregnant women living in\\nGaziantep and vitamin A deficiency was found in 17% of\\nthe subjects(28). Especially, emphasizing the decrease in\\nvitamin A in the last three months suggests that the risk of\\nvitamin A deficiency will increase during lactation.\\nIn different studies, severe vitamin D deficiency was\\nfound with a rate of 10-27%, moderate vitamin D deficiency\\nwas found with a rate of 40-54% and mild vitamin D\\ndeficiency was found with a rate of 40% in pregnancy\\n(29,30). The more unpleasant finding was that the rate of\\ndeficiency in the control group who were not pregnant was\\nalso high (severe deficiency 27%, moderate deficiency\\n45%) (29). In another study, severe vitamin D deficiency\\nwas found in the last three months of pregnancy in 46% of\\npregnant Turkish women (31).\\n\\n\\x0c186\\n\\nMukadder Ayşe Selimoğlu\\nNutrition in lactating mothers\\n\\nIn a study, vitamin D deficiency was found with\\nrates of 40%, 60% and 100% in our women who were\\nopen, moderately veiled and completely veiled women,\\nrespectively (32). In a study conducted with adolescents,\\nvitamin D inadequacy was found with a rate of 44% and\\nvitamin D deficiency was found with a rate of 21% (33).\\nVitamin D deficiency was found in half of adolescent girls\\nwho were veiled and living in a city (33).\\n\\nConclusions\\nNutrition of nursing mothers is special. It is very\\nsignificant in terms of both the mother’s own health and\\nthe infant’s health. The nutritional content of the mother is\\naffected by diet with a low rate bringing protection of the\\ninfant to forefront. Even if the diet of the mother is poor\\nin terms of protein, fat, carbonhydrate and folate, the\\namounts in breastmilk stay adequate (34). However, this\\nstate which does not affect the infant leads to deficiency in\\nthe mother’s stores and consequently harms the mother.\\nThe levels of vitamin A and B in breastmilk are dependent\\nto the mother’s diet. If they are deficient in the mother,\\ndeficiency also develops in the infant. Studies performed\\nin Turkey show that micronutrient deficiency in mothers in\\nTurkey is a significant problem and micronutrient deficit is\\npresent with a high frequency in mothers. Considering that\\napproximately 6% of our mothers are in the adolescence\\nduring which growth and development is not completed yet,\\nit is clear that nutritional supplements in mothers will be\\nbeneficial in terms of public health. In this context, it is a\\nsignificant priority that nutrition in mothers is emphasized\\nand plans are produced in terms of both the mother’s\\nhealth and ideal breastmilk content.\\n\\nReferences\\n1.

Your baby may not\\neven seem real yet. However the choices you make and what you eat\\nnow and every day you are pregnant or breastfeeding can affect your\\nhealth and the health of your baby.\\nIt is your choice:\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nwhat you eat\\nwhether you drink alcohol and/or smoke\\nhow much your weight may change\\nhow often you see your doctor\\n\\nPregnancy is a very important period. It is a time to think about your\\nlifestyle, habits and diet and how they affect you and your future child.\\nIt is a time to consider if you wish to adopt healthy habits that will be\\nbeneficial to you and your baby both now and in the future.\\nIt is never too late to make the right choices.\\nWhen you are expecting a baby or breastfeeding a baby, nutritious\\nfood is very important for both of you:\\nFor You: pregnancy and lactation place extra demands on your body.\\nTo meet these demands you need to think about what is best to eat and\\ndrink. Good nutrition in pregnancy helps you to stay healthy and\\nenergetic and to prepare yourself for taking care of you, your new\\nbaby and the rest of the family.\\nFor Your Baby: through your milk your baby eats everything you eat.\\nThus, the best way of giving your baby a healthy diet is for you to eat a\\nhealthy diet.\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nThe Placenta - carries life to your baby:\\nThe placenta brings important things, such as oxygen and nutrients, to\\nyour baby and it removes the waste products that your baby produces\\nwhile in your womb.\\nHowever the placenta cannot stop harmful substances such as alcohol\\nand nicotine, from smoking, crossing from you to your baby\\n\\nHealthy diet - what does it mean?\\nContrary to a sometimes often quoted saying, you do not have to “eat\\nfor two” - or double the amount of food you normally eat.\\nFrom about the 3rd month of pregnancy you need ONLY an extra 200300 kcal per day in addition to the diet you ate before you became\\npregnant. This small extra amount can be achieved, by eating for\\nexample 2-3 slices of bread extra (or 1 glass of milk and 1-2 slices of\\nbread extra) per day.\\nA healthy diet is one that is based mainly on plant foods. Therefore it is\\nimportant to eat lots of vegetables, fruits, bread, potatoes, pasta,\\ncereals, beans and lentils accompanied by only relatively small amounts\\nof: low fat milk, cheeses, kefir and yogurts; fish, lean red meats, and\\npoultry. Whenever possible try to get locally grown vegetables and\\nfruits, especially when they are in season. These can be less\\nexpensive, more nutrient dense, fresh and safe from contamination.\\nThe following explanation highlights the relative importance of different\\nfoods by placing them into 5 food groups.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nFood Groups\\n1. Bread, cereals, pasta, rice and potato group - aim to eat 6-11\\nportions per day\\n\\nWhat counts as one portion?\\n1 large slice of bread (about 30-40 g)\\n3 small crackers or sooshka\\n1/2 cup cooked pasta (macaroni, spaghetti etc.)\\n1/2 cup cooked cereal (rice, buckwheat or oatmeal)\\n3/4 cup (about 30g) ready-to eat dry cereal\\n1 medium potato (100g)\\nFoods from this group provide you with your main source of energy. They\\nalso contain many other important nutrients, such as calcium, iron, zinc and\\nB vitamins. Potatoes are also a good source of vitamin C.\\nUnrefined cereals and wholemeal bread are good sources of fiber\\nwhich prevents constipation which you may experience more of\\nduring pregnancy.\\nSome breakfast cereals may be fortified with vitamins such as folic\\nacid - check the label.\\nTry to eat a variety of foods from this group, including wholemeal and\\nrye breads, macaroni, spaghetti, rice, buckwheat, oatmeal or your\\ntraditional cereal and potatoes.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\n2. Vegetables and fruits group - aim to eat at least 5 portions per\\nday (more than 400g)\\n\\nWhat counts as one portion?\\n1/2 cup (about 100 g) of vegetables (for example:\\ncarrots, onions, beets, leeks, turnip etc. – including\\nthat eaten in soups and stews)\\n1 cup of green leafy vegetables (cabbage, lettuce,\\nspinach, broccoli, etc.)\\n1 medium tomato\\n1/2 cup of sprouted beans\\n1 medium piece of fruit (1 apple or 1 pear or 2 small\\nplums)\\n1/2 cup (about 100 g) of fresh, preserved, or cooked\\nberries\\n160 ml fruit or vegetable juice (pure 100% juice - try\\nfresh carrot and orange squeezed and mixed)\\nVegetables and fruits provide the best source of many vitamins and\\nminerals, including folate and iron, which are important to prevent you\\nbecoming anaemic during pregnancy. Remember, vitamins such as\\nvitamin C are needed both by you and your baby and cannot be stored\\nin your body. Thus, it is important to eat plenty of vegetables and fruits\\nevery day, especially those that are locally grown.\\nEach of the following will give you enough vitamin C every day:\\n1 large pepper or 3 medium potatoes or 160 g of cabbage.\\nIn addition vegetables contain many protective components which help\\nkeep us healthy: fibre, flavonoids and many more substances which we\\nhave not even discovered yet! This is one reason why vitamin and\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nmineral tablets cannot replace the vegetables we eat.\\nFresh vegetables and fruits may sometimes be difficult to find. Out of\\nseason, when fresh produce may not be available, don’t forget about\\nfrozen, home-preserved, tinned, pic kled and dried varieties - they also\\ncontain essential nutrients. You might like to try “sprouting” beans\\nwhen no other sources of vitamin C are available.\\nThe following fresh weight of sprouted beans will provide 10 mg\\nvitamin C:\\nBlack-eyed beans\\nFenugreek, Mung beans, green lentils\\nHaricot, Alfalfa\\n\\n50 g\\n70 g\\n90 g\\n\\nRemember, that vitamin C is lost during storage and preparation.\\nTherefore it is important to cook vegetables in a minimum amount of\\nboiling water for only 5 to 10 minutes. Try steaming, baking or\\nmicrowaving instead of boiling. Try to eat raw fresh or lightly cooked\\nvegetables every day and try not to add excess fats, oils and salt.\\n3. Milk and dairy products group - aim to eat 3 portions a day\\n\\nWhat counts as one portion?\\n1 cup (about 200 ml) of yogurt/kefir\\n45 g of hard cheese (the size of matchbox)\\n1,5 cup (about 250 g) of cottage cheese\\n1 glass (300 ml) of milk\\nDairy products are one of the richest sources of calcium in your diet.\\nCalcium is essential for the development of healthy bones and teeth of\\nyour baby; in lactation it is important for the formation of your own\\nbreast milk. However if you do not eat calcium containing foods your\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nbaby will not suffer since calcium will be taken from your body stores.\\nBut for your own health it is important that you replace your stores of\\ncalcium.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nDairy products are also a good source of protein and other minerals\\nand vitamins, such as some B vitamins, vitamin A and sometimes\\niodine depending on whether or not the cows are fed iodine fortified\\nfodder.\\nContrary to the beliefs of some people, creamy, high-fat milk and dairy\\nproducts are not healthier than low-fat alternatives. Where possible\\nchoose low-fat milk, kefir and low-fat milk products - they contain\\nmore calcium and protein and have a lower fat content, so are good for\\nall of the family.\\nRemember, that neither butter (made from the cream of milk) nor\\ncream contribute calcium or protein to your diet, only fat.\\n4. Fish, poultry, meat and bean group - aim to eat 2 portions a\\nday\\n\\nWhat counts as one portion?\\n1 cup (about 150-200 g) of cooked beans\\n2 eggs\\n70-80 g of cooked lean fish, poultry or meat\\nThis group includes beans and lentils, fish, meat, poultry, eggs and nuts,\\nwhich are all rich in protein. Try to eat a wide variety, especially beans,\\nlentils, nuts and fish, these are especially healthy for you and your family.\\nMeat, especially organ meats (such as liver and kidney), provide some of\\nthe best sources of iron. Iron from meat is absorbed better than iron from\\nplant sources. However, liver should be taken in moderation to avoid\\nexcess intake of vitamin A.\\nChoose lean varieties of meat or cut the fat off when possible, think\\nabout limiting the amount of smoked and salt-cured sausages if you eat\\nthese often because it is better not to eat too much salt and fat.\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\n5. Lard, butter, margarine, oils, sugar, sweets and salt group - use\\nsparingly\\n\\nThis group includes butter, margarine, oils, lard, sugars, candies, sweet\\ndesserts, pastry, sweetened drinks: in other words foods that have a\\nhigh fat, salt and/or sugar content.\\nThese foods are dense in calories but provide little in the way of other\\nnutrients. Therefore it is better not to indulge in these products at the\\nexpense of more nutritious foods from the other food groups.\\nTry to use oils (such as olive, canola or rapeseed oil) instead of animal\\nfats as much as possible, but if this is not possible then just try to\\nreduce the total amount of fat you eat.\\nRemember, eating a diet low in fat and, especially low in animal fat,\\nreduces your and your family’s risk of getting certain cancers and\\ncardiovascular disease - the two major “killers” of the population in\\nEurope .\\nConsume salt in moderation (up to 6 g per day in total): try to use less\\nsalt at the table and in cooking, eat less salty or pickled foods. This will\\ndecrease your risk of high blood pressure and related health problems.\\nTry whenever possible to get salt which is iodized to ensure that you\\nand especially your baby get enough iodine during pregnancy and\\nbreastfeeding.\\n\\nRemember these important nutrients\\n1. Folic acid\\n\\nThis vitamin is extremely important during pregnancy, especially in the\\nearly period and even before conception.\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nA good intake of folate greatly increases the chance of your baby\\nbeing born without any abnormalities, thus, all women thinking about\\nbecoming pregnant, and throughout the first 3 months of pregnancy,\\nshould eat food sources rich in folate. Eat plenty of folate-rich foods\\nsuch as spinach, lettuce, cabbage, green beans, cauliflower and\\nfortified cereals.\\nSome women who are at particularly high risk of folate deficiency may\\nbe advised to take a daily supplement of 400 mcg (0,4 mg) of folic acid\\nbut you should talk to your doctor about this.\\n2. Iron\\n\\nYou need iron to form the red blood cells for you and your baby. Iron\\nhelps to carry oxygen in your blood from the lungs to the tissues. Your\\nbaby’s brain and body need iron and oxygen to grow.\\nToo little iron leads to anaemia, in which case your baby may not be\\ngetting enough oxygen for normal growth and development.\\nFortunately your ability to absorb iron increases during pregnancy and\\nwhile you are breastfeeding.\\nThe best sources of iron are lean meats, especially liver and kidney.\\nSome vegetables (e.g. green leafy vegetables, cooked beans and peas)\\nare also a good sources of iron. To absorb more iron from vegetables\\n(especially beans and peas), eat foods rich in vitamin C or acidic foods\\nat the same time (e.g. fruits, juice, bell peppers, tomatoes, kefir,\\nfermented foods). Tea and coffee reduce your ability to absorb iron, so\\ntry to drink them between meals rather than when eating iron rich\\nfoods.\\nIn case of extreme tiredness you may be suffering from iron\\ndeficiency anemia. Discuss this with you doctor who may wish to\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nprescribe iron supplements for you. Do not take iron supplements\\nunless advised by the doctor. They can cause constipation and may\\ninterfere with the absorption of other nutrients.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\n3. Calcium\\n\\nCalcium is important for the healthy bones and teeth of both you and\\nyour baby. The best sources of calcium are milk, dairy products and\\nsome cereals. Try to choose low fat milk, kefir cheese and yogurt, they\\nprovide more calcium than full fat varieties.\\n4. Vitamin D\\n\\nVitamin D is very important both to prevent rickets in your newborn\\nbaby and to keep your teeth and bones healthy.\\nTry to spend as much time as you can outdoors, especially in sunny\\nweather: vitamin D is produced in your skin when you are exposed to\\nsunlight.\\nVitamin D is found also in foods, such as oily fish, eggs, butter, and\\nfortified margarine. In the Northern parts of Europe with low amounts\\nof sunlight you may be prescribed supplements by your doctor,\\nespecially during the winter months.\\n\\nWhat about multivitamin supplements?\\nDo not take vitamin or mineral supplements unless prescribed by your\\ndoctor. Besides being an unnecessary expense, an excessive intake of\\nthese supplements can cause toxic effects or interfere with the\\nabsorption of other nutrients.\\n\\nWhat about fluids?\\nDrink plenty water - 6 to 8 glasses a day. Women who are\\nbreastfeeding should drink the amount needed to satisfy their thirst.\\nWater, milk products and unsweetened juices are the best choices.\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nLimit tea and coffee to in-between meals in order not to interfere too\\nmuch with iron absorption. Try to avoid excessive amounts of\\nlemonade or drinks with a high sugar content, especially if you are\\ngaining too much weight.\\n\\nSome substances may harm your baby\\n1. Alcohol\\n\\nTry not to drink alcohol during pregnancy. An occasional glass of wine\\nat special events is OK.\\nAlcohol crosses placenta and can lead to physical, growth and mental\\nproblems in some babies. It is especially important not to drink alcohol\\nat the time of conception and during the first 3 months of pregnancy\\nwhen the embryo is most vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol.\\n2. Smoking\\n\\nTry not to smoke during pregnancy or at least try to reduce smoking\\nsubstantially. Mothers who are heavy smokers are at much higher risk\\nof having low birth weight babies. Smoking can also be a cause of\\npremature birth, miscarriage and stillbirth and may impair your child’s\\ngrowth and development.\\nRemember: it is never too late to stop or at least reduce smoking or\\ndrinking. Your baby will benefit from each alcoholic drink or cigarette\\nyou give up!\\n3. Caffeine\\n\\nEffects of caffeine on the foetus are not well established yet. Tea,\\ncocoa and cola -type drinks contain about the same amount of caffeine\\nwhile coffee contains about twice as much caffeine. Try to limit your\\n17\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\ncoffee intake to 3-4 cups a day.\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nRemember also, that tea and coffee tend to impair your ability to\\nabsorb iron from foods, such as beans and cereals, and iron\\nsupplements.\\n4. Medications\\n\\nMany medications can adversely affect your baby and are contraindicated for pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.\\nConsult your doctor before taking any medications, including aspirin\\nand vitamin supplements.\\n\\nHow much weight do you gain during pregnancy?\\nOn average you should expect to gain 10-12,5 kg by the end of your\\npregnancy.\\nStarting with the 4th month of your pregnancy you will probably gain\\naround 1,5-2 kg per month. Check your weight periodically and consult the\\ndoctor if you notice you are gaining less than 1 kg or more than 3 kg per\\nmonth.\\nBoth too little and too much weight gain can adversely affect the\\nhealth of you and your baby. Thus, make sure that you and your baby\\nget enough calories, but do not overeat (especially sweets and fatty\\nfoods). Remember, “eating for two” does not mean “twice as much”.\\nJust follow your appetite and the healthy eating advice in this booklet.\\nAvoid excess under- or overeating.\\n\\nIf your weight before pregnancy was substantially lower or higher\\nthan normal, ask your doctor for specialized advice on diet and\\nweight gain.\\nRemember, during your pregnancy is not a good time to go on a diet in\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nan attempt to lose weight!\\n\\nHow to cope with the food-related problems during\\npregnancy\\n1. Morning sickness\\n\\nAbout 70% of women suffer from sickness, usually in early pregnancy\\n- around week 9-10. Later, by the end of the 4th month of pregnancy,\\nsymptoms usually disappear or become much milder. To relieve the\\nsymptoms of sickness, try to:\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\neat small but frequent meals (with about 2 hr intervals)\\navoid smells and foods that make your sickness worse\\neat more nutritious carbohydrate foods: try dry toasts or\\ncrackers, breakfast cereals, fruits and vegetable salads at any\\ntime during the day\\neat less fatty and sugary foods\\n\\n2. Constipation\\n\\n35-40% of pregnant women suffer from constipation during\\npregnancy.\\nHow to deal with the problem:\\n•\\n•\\n\\ndrink plenty of fluid such as plain water (6-8 cups a day)\\nincrease intake of foods rich in fiber (wholemeal bread, brown\\nrice, wholegrain cereals, fresh and dried vegetables and fruits,\\nespecially prunes and figs)\\n\\nRemember, iron supplements can sometimes cause or aggravate the\\nsymptoms of constipation. If you are taking iron supplements and\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nnotice that the symptoms of constipation progress, consult your doctor.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\n3. Heartburn\\n\\nMay occur anytime during pregnancy, but symptoms usually get worse\\nat the end of pregnancy. Also a common problem - about 30-50% of\\npregnant women suffer from heartburn.\\nSome suggestions on how to deal with the problem:\\n•\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\navoid chocolate, fatty foods, alcohol and mint, especially\\nbefore bedtime - they tend to relax oesophageal muscle so that\\nacid from the stomach regurgitates up into the oesophagus\\nmore easily\\navoid acidic and spicy foods that may irritate mucosa (tomato,\\ncitrus fruits and juices, vinegar, hot pepper, etc.)\\nmilk and dairy products can temporarily relieve the symptoms\\nof heartburn\\neat slowly, drink fluids between meals rather than with meals\\neat small frequent meals, do not eat large meals before\\nbedtime\\nsleep well propped up, not lying flat\\n\\nRemember to consult your doctor before taking antacid medications.\\nSome antacids can bind iron in foods and make iron unavailable for you\\nto absorb.\\n\\nGuidelines for successful breastfeeding\\nBreastfeeding can be a wonderful experience both for you and your\\nbaby.\\nRemember:\\n•\\n\\nbreast milk is by far the best food for your newborn baby; no\\n22\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\ncommercial-made baby formula as well as any other food or drink\\ncan match breast milk;\\nbreastfeeding (as compared to artificial feeding) protects against\\ncommon infections, especially diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases as\\nwell as urinary tract and ear infections;\\nbreastfeed as often as baby wants, do not restrict frequency of\\nfeeding according to a timetable;\\nlet the baby come off the breast spontaneously, do not take baby off\\nthe breast before the baby is finished;\\ntry to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months and then continue for as\\nlong and often as possible (exclusively means giving your baby\\nonly breastmilk for 6 months – no other fluids, including water,\\ntea or glucose!);\\nanaemia is not a contra-indication to breastfeeding and even if\\nyou are anaemic you should continue to breast feed;\\nweight loss is not a contra-indication to breastfeeding and even\\nif you have lost weight you should continue to breast feed;\\nyou should not stop breastfeeding even if you are smoking or\\noccasionally consume alcohol – your milk is still the best food\\nfor your baby.\\n\\nYou can get more information on breastfeeding from a WHO booklet\\nfor mothers on infant feeding (available on internet:\\nhttp://www.who.dk/Nutrition/main.htm).\\n\\nHealthy eating for women who are breastfeeding\\nAfter birth you will probably be about 3-4 kg over your pre-pregnant\\nweight. Don’t try to lose weight immediately – since these stores are\\nused to make breast milk. Breast milk production itself demands a lot\\nof energy - so breastfeeding will help you to get back to a normal\\nweight.\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nThe principles of healthy nutrition recommended for pregnancy apply\\nalso during breastfeeding.\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\nRemember:\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nalcohol can pass into the breast milk, so do not drink or at least\\nrestrict alcohol intake during lactation;\\nthere is no evidence of any beneficial effect of alcohol on\\nbreast milk production;\\nsmoking may decrease your ability to produce breast milk and\\nthus affect the growth of your baby, smoking also decreases\\nthe vitamin C content in breast milk;\\ntry not to harm the lungs of your newborn child - never smoke\\nin baby’s room;\\ncaffeine can pass into the breast milk and cause hyperactivity\\nand sleeping problems in your baby - try not to drink too much\\ncoffee, tea and cola drinks (recommendations are the same as\\nfor pregnancy);\\nmany medications can also pass into breast milk - check with\\nyour doctor before taking any (however, taking most\\nmedications is not a contraindication to a breastfeeding)\\n\\nTips on food safety and preparation\\nDuring pregnancy and breastfeeding you should be particularly careful\\nabout not getting an infection from contaminated food products.\\nSome bacteria and parasites can be harmful to your unborn baby.\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\ndo not eat raw or undercooked eggs: eggs must be well\\ncooked so that both white and yolk are hard;\\navoid home-made pates or pates that are not canned;\\navoid unpasteurized ice creams and unpasteurized (or\\nunboiled) milk;\\nthoroughly cook meat and poultry; make sure the frozen meats\\nare defrosted properly before cooking;\\n25\\n\\n\\x0cHealthy Eating during Pregnancy and Breastfeeding\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n_\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nthoroughly re-heat ready-to-eat meals and leftovers before\\nserving;\\nstore raw meat in the refrigerator so that it does not drip and\\ncontaminate other foods; wash your hands and kitchen\\nsurfaces after handling meat;\\nthoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables;\\nto preserve vitamins boil vegetables in a minimum amount of\\nwater, do not overcook; try cooking over steam or\\nmicrowaving (if you have a microwave);\\nif you use microwave, follow manufacturer’s instructions and\\nmake sure that food is cooked right through to the centre;\\ncheck the use-by date on the food package;\\nwear gloves when gardening and wash hands afterwards;\\n\\navoid contact with cats, use gloves when handling cat\\nexcrements: cats can be the source of Toxoplasmosis serious infection that can cause blindness, mental retardation\\nor even intrauterine death of the foetus.\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0c\\nNUTRITION EDUCATION FOR\\nLACTATING MOTHERS AND\\nWEANING-AGE INFANTS\\nIN BANGLADESH:\\nPolicy Implications of an Evaluation\\n\\nprepared by the\\nSocial Sector Policy\\nAnalysis Project\\nOperated by the\\nAcademy for Educational Development\\nfor the\\nAgency for International Development\\nPPC/PCPR/SP\\n\\n\\x0cNUTRITION EDUCATION FOR LACTATING\\nMOTHERS AND WEANING-AGE INFANTS\\nIN BANGLADESH:\\nPolicy Implications of an Evaluation\\n\\nA synthesis prepared by:\\nMildred A.

Women in the study\\nresponded to the nutrition\\nmessages and wanted to improve\\nthe quantity and quality of food in\\ntheir diets, but their families were\\nunable to make substantial\\nincreases in expenditures for food.\\nI lowever, families were able to\\nmake smaller expenditures to add\\nweaning fxods to children\\'s diets\\nand improve their nutritional status,\\nThe evaluation confirmed previous\\nresearch showing that culturallyappropriate nutrition messages can\\nchange infant feeding practices,\\neven in a conservative culture\\nwhere poverty is extreme.\\nThe major policy\\nrecommendations are:\\ne\\n\\nThat nutrition education to\\nimprove women\\'s diets be\\nincorporated into programs that\\nmake these improvements\\naffordable, such as women\\'s\\nsaving groups, incomegenerating projects, agricultural\\nproduction, home gardens, or\\nsubsidized or donated food\\nprograms;\\n\\ne That nutrition education to\\nimprove the diets of weaningage children encourage families\\nto provide hygienic,\\ncomplementary feeding of\\nsimple, low-cost, energy-rich\\n\\nfood to breastfed infants over\\nfour to six months of age. This\\neducation can be effective with\\nor without other program\\nsupports.\\n\\nThe Nutrition Education\\nInterventioris\\nTo improve the nutrition of\\nmothers and infants, the\\nBangladesh Rural Advancement\\nCommittee (BRAC) and Tufts\\nUniversity conducted two nutrition\\neducation interventions in rural\\nBangladesh in 1987. The\\nintervention site included five\\nvillages with a total population of\\napproximately 12,000. The villages\\nwere without electricity, isolated\\nfrom transportation networks, and\\nhad no other development\\nprograms. Eight village workers\\n(five female and three male) and\\none male supervisor initiated\\nintervention activities. They\\nreviewed community responses to a\\nnutritional needs assessment,\\nbrainstormed with technical staff\\nand conducted in-home problem\\ndiagnoses and behavioral-change\\ntrials to develop persuasive and\\npractical nutrition messages. After\\ntesting messages in their own\\nhomes, village workers trained\\nvolunteer mothers, who further\\nrefined the messages with their own\\nchildren and then disseminated the\\nmessages to other village mothers.\\nSince Bangladeshi mothers have\\nlimited control over their food\\nbudgets and portions, the approach\\nwas family-oriented. Messages\\nappealed to the family\\'s desire for\\nstrong, healthy children; they were\\nfeasible, specific, motivating, and\\nmemorable. Only education was\\ngiven (no food supplements).\\n\\n\\x0cTo improve the diets of lactating\\nwomen so they could adequately\\nbreastfeed, the village workers\\ntrained volunteers with infants\\nunder six months of age to\\ndisseminate messages to other\\nfamilies with young infants. The\\n\\nVillage workers trained other\\nvolunteers to disseminate messages\\naimed at encouraging families to\\nimprove the diets of children six to\\ntwelve months of age. The\\nvolunteer mothers conducted in\\xad\\nhome demonstrations of snack-type\\n\\nmessages encouraged the mothers\\nto eat an extra serving of all foods\\nthey were eating at meals, to\\nincrease fluid intake, to use good\\nhygiene practices and to offer both\\nbreasts to the baby at each feeding.\\n(See Figure 1.) This lactation\\nintervention reached 48 mothers\\n(lactation intervention treatment\\ngroup).\\n\\nrecipes and techniques to enrich\\nfoods from the family pot.

The woman\\'s\\nshare alone would require an\\nadditional cost of 21 percent of the\\ndaily wage for an agricultural\\nlaborer; increasing food allocations\\nto other family members would be\\neven more costly. Family budgets\\nwere too tight to permit such\\nincreased expenditures for food.\\nTypically, women eat last, and are\\ntrained to be self-sacrificing.\\nLactating mothers felt\\nuncomfortable about taking more\\nfood for themselves than they\\nserved to others. In many cases,\\nthe option of taking more for\\nthemselves did not even exist; there\\nsimply was no more food.\\n\\n\\x0cMothers were philosophical:\\n\\'\"hen we have food, we eat it;\\nwhen we don\\'t, we don\\'t.\" They\\nrealized that when they ate \"good\\nfood,\" they had more breastmilk,\\nbut they were unable to acquire\\nmore food. The message they liked\\nbest was: \"Drink eight or more\\nglasses of water a day and you will\\nhave more milk.\" They could\\ncomply with this message without\\nspending money. In fact, many\\nwomen believed that good health\\nwas only attainable by the wealthy.\\nTheir husbands were frank about\\n,he financial realities: \"We are poor\\nand cannot afford more food.\" In\\nfact, in a sampling of households\\ninterviewed, weekly food\\nexpenditures were already greater\\nthan weekly income. When asked\\nhow this was possible, most men\\nrevealed they were constantly taking\\nout loans from neighbors, and, if\\npossible, from banks. Most of the\\nmen were very thin themselves,\\nsuggesting they too were getting\\nless than their required level of\\nfood.\\nMen varied in their receptiveness\\nto education about the nutritional\\nneeds of their wives. Some did not\\nsee nutrition as being within the\\nscope of their responsibilities. \"The\\nfather\\'s duty is to make the income\\nand bring the food,\" they said. \"The\\nmother\\'s duty is to care for the\\nchild and inform the father of the\\nchild\\'s needs (e.g. medicine).\" Most\\nof the men were not willing to\\nteach other men about nutrition,\\nexcept for informal discussions at\\nthe market or mosque.\\nLactating mothers who received\\nnutrition educatioa were less\\nlikely to have children who\\nbecame severely malnourished\\n\\nthan mothers in the control\\ngroup; however there were no\\nsignificant differences in overall\\nchild nutritional status or growth\\nrates.\\nAt baseline, there were no\\nsignificant differences in nutritional\\nstatus between the infants, of\\nwomen receiving the education and\\nthose in the control group. Th:\\xad\\naverage nutritional status of both\\ngroups deteriorated during the\\nstudy (as measured by the infant\\'s\\nweight for age and arm\\ncircumference) and at the final\\nmeasure there were no significant\\ndifferences between the two\\ngroups. Ilowever, differences in\\nlevels of severe malnutrition did\\noccur. In the control group, the\\nnumber of infants who became\\nseverely malnourished increased\\nsignificantly. In the treatment\\ngroup, the number of infants\\nbecoming malnourished also\\nincreased, but the level of increase\\nwas not statistically significant.\\nThese slight differences suggest that\\neducation may have helped to\\nprevent severe malnutrition.\\n\\n\\x0cFindings: The Weaning\\nIntervention\\nChildren in families that received\\neducation on complementary\\n(weaning) foods grew\\nsignificantly better than children\\nin co ntro l fam ilies.\\nAt baseline in May, the average\\nchild in both treatment and control\\ngroups was moderately\\nmalnourished.

The nutrition\\n\\n6\\n\\no%\\n\\nOi\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\nPolicy Recommendations\\nFrom the experience of this\\nnutrition education program in\\n\\nrural Bangladesh, what guidance\\ncan be derived for planning and\\nimplementing other nutrition\\ncducation programs? Eight major\\nrecommendation! are listed and\\nexplained below,\\n\\n1. Incorporate natrition\\neducation for improving\\nwomen\\'s diets into programs\\nthat make these\\niml \\'rovements a!fordable,\\n\\nCofdlthof rn Buglades\\nIn Bangladesh, many conditions limit opportunities to\\nachieve good health and proper nutritior,. People ate\\nvecy poor. Food shortages occur seasonally and few\\ntechnologies exist for preserving food in the tropical\\nclimate. Overpopulation, poor sanitation, and a poorly\\nfunctioning health infrastructure add further difficulties.\\nWomen have very low status; 80 percent have never\\n\\nbeen to school, and cannot read, write or understand\\nnumbers. Widesrread m.,cmal undernutrition is\\nreflected in the fact that more than o.o-qua\\'ter of all\\nnewborns are born with low birth weight. Childhood\\n\\nmalnutrition anid mortlity rates are among the highest in\\nth\\'_ world. Frequent bouts of child\\n\\nillness restrain growth\\n\\nsuch as women\\'s savings\\ngroups, income-generating\\n\\nand reduce child appetite.\\n\\nprcjects, agricultural\\nproduction, hcme gardens, or\\nsubsidized or donatted food\\n\\nIn ruidi areas, mothers breastfeed their children for two,\\nand sometimes three, years. Breast-nilk provides\\nsubstantial amounts of tho energy (calories), protein,\\nvitamin A, and other nutrients for children up to age two\\nor three, but by the time the child is six months old, the\\n\\nprograms.\\n\\nMost of the women in this study\\nwanted to improve the quantity and\\nquality of their diets, but fe\\'t\\nhelpless to do so. Economic\\nconstraints were paramount. In\\n\\norder to consume an adequate diet\\nusing low cost foods, the lactating\\nwomen would need to ijearly\\ndouble their food budgets--an\\nadditional cost of 2 1 pe\\'ceit of the\\ndaily wage. In reality, thes-e costs\\n\\nquantities are grossly insufficient. This is in part due to\\nthe poorly nourished state of the mothers. Traditionally,\\nBangladeshi women do not persistently encourage their\\ninfants to eat other foods until about 18 months of age.\\nNo traditionnl weaning mixtures exist; the first foods\\noffe,.d -.:e \"istlahydiluted cow\\'. milk or cereal pruel.\\n\\nBangtactesh isone of the tbree countries in the world\\nwhere women have ashorter life expectancy than men.\\nThe overall poor maternal nutrition status is worsened by\\n\\nseasonal food scarcity and frequent pregnancies. A\\nr.itional survey found that pregnant and lactating women\\n\\n(onsumed c-ly 70 percent of their energy requirement\\nand 65 percen, of their estimated protein requirement.\\n\\nwould be even greater because the\\nwomen would be unable to eat\\nmore themselves without also\\n\\nNumerous cultural food practices work to women\\'s\\ndisadvantage. Men and children eat first, nd women eat\\nwhat food remains, if any. In contrast with many other\\nagricultural societ:es, women do not work in the fields.\\n\\nother household members.\\n\\nExcept for collecting Firewood and water, women are\\n\\nAlthough the study focused on\\nlactating women, the conclusions\\ncan be generalized to all women of\\nchildbearing age, including\\nadolescents and pregnant women.\\nThe specific nutrient needs and\\ncultural taboos may differ slightly,\\nbut financial and cultural barriers\\naffect the nutrition of all women.\\n\\nconfined to the honme and spead their days cooking,\\ncleaning, and caring for children and elders. They have\\nno control over the food supply budget. It is men who\\nharvest and buy and sell food in the market.\\nThese conditions illustrate the extent to which cultural\\nand economic barriers make it difficult for families to\\nmeet the nutritional needs of women and weaning-age\\n\\nchildren.\\n\\n\\x0cEven participation in incomegenerating programs and women\\'s\\nsavings groups, and acquiring\\naccess to money would not result\\nautomatically in women improving\\ntheir own diets. Experience with\\nsuch programs in Bangladesh\\nsuggests that many women have\\nachieved savings, but still don\\'t\\nspend money on themselves. Since\\nBangladeshi women are taught\\nthroughout their lives to be selfsacrificing, they may need to learn\\nto spend money on themselves,\\n2. En\\'\\'ourage families to provide\\nhygienic, complementary\\nfeeding of simple, low-cost,\\nenergy-rich food to breastfed\\ninfants over four to six\\nmonths of age.\\nIn the Bangladesh context, the\\nbreastfeeding infant\\'s diet could be\\nimproved with a low-cost weaning\\nfood for about one-third of the\\nadditional cost for inproving a\\nlactating woman\\'s diet, or less than\\n8 percent of the daily wage .\\nImproving the infant\\'s diet is\\nfeasible because. 1) family\\nmembers, especially mothers, have\\ncontrol over the child\\'s diet; 2)\\ninvesting in children is valued; 3)\\nonly small amounts of additional\\nfood are needed because breastmilk\\nprovides the bulk of the young\\nchild\\'s diet.\\nThis intervention has shown that,\\nunder conditions of extreme\\npoverty and pocr sanitation (such\\nas those observed in rural\\nBangladesh), nutrition education\\nalone can only prevent further\\ndeterioration in nutritional status.\\nHowever, it will not be sufficient to\\nbring the c! Iren up to the\\ninternationai standards unless\\nsocioeconomic conditions are\\n\\nimproved. Integrating nutrition\\neducation with other income\\xad\\ngenerating or food-production\\nprograms increases the potential for\\nchange.\\n3. Conduct village-level research\\nto design appropriate\\nmessages for nutrition\\neducation.\\nVillage-level research can be very\\nhelpful in designing appropriate\\nmessages. This research should be\\nconducted before wide-scale project\\nimplementation, to ensure that\\nmessages are appropriate,\\naffordable, and understood by the\\nrecipients. Effective nutrition\\neducation involves much more than\\nmemorization of carefully-worded\\nmessages. The words simply\\nexpress a concept; the educational\\nprocess must effectively promote\\nt.,e behavior communicated by the\\nmessage. For e:xample, village\\nworkers who helped design the\\nmessages in this study, preferred\\ncatchy, poetic phrases, considering\\nthem to be \"sbundor\"(beautiful), a\\nvalued virtue in Bangladesh culture.\\nInitially, the workers tried to teach\\nthe mothers to repeat, verbatim, the\\nbeautiful rhythmic messages.\\nIn so doing, the focus was on\\nmemorization, not actual practice of\\nthe content of the message. After\\ndiscussion, the village workers\\ndecided to ask mothers to repeat\\nonly the sense of the message, and\\nnot the poetry in totality. \"The real\\ntest of the message was whether it\\nwas practiced.\"\\nThe messages must be based on\\nsound knowledge of foods\\nconsumed and local cultural beliefs\\nand practices. A widely-held\\nperception in this setting that\\nchildren are not fed complementary\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nfoods until w ell into their second\\nyear was not an accurate\\ndescription of practice. Through\\nprobing and observation, village\\nworkers discovered that many\\nfamilies offer bits and pieces of a\\nvariety of appropriate weaning\\n\\n.........................................\\nFig 9.

The cost of improving\\nwomen\\'s diets is the same, whether\\npromoted through snacks or meals.\\n\\n6. Design strategies to help\\ncaretakers deal with feeding\\nproblems in young children\\nand prevent and control\\ninfections.\\n\\n5. Train village-level workers to\\ndemonstrate food preparation\\nmethods and to model\\nexpected behaviors.\\n\\nOne of the most common reasons\\nreported for not giving more\\ncomplementary food was because\\n\"the child refused.\" One budget\\nconscious father, impatient with the\\ntime often needed for normal child\\nfeeding development, became very\\nangry when he purchased the\\ningredients for a snack food, only\\nto have the child spit it out. A\\nreality of child development is that\\nno matter how nutritious, misty, and\\nappropriate a food, one can never\\nguarantee that a child will eat it.\\n\\nThe lactation and weaning\\ninterventions involved recipients in\\nthe development of appropriate\\nmessages. Families learned best by\\nobserving other families practicing\\nthe messages. Both interventions\\nused the same educational\\napproach, but the weaning food\\nmessages demanded more active\\nparticipation by recipients, for\\nexample, through the preparation\\nof special recipes. The messages of\\nthe lactation intervention\\nencouraged \"more\" of what the\\nwomen were already doing. The\\nsuccess of the weaning food\\nmessages may lie in part with the\\nfact that they were not too timeconsuming, and demanded active\\nparticipation, thus were more\\n\\nWhy do children not demand and\\nconsume sufficie.nt quantities of\\nfood to sustain normal growth?\\nOne of the many reasons appears to\\nbe illness. Children experience\\nfrequent acute infectious episodes\\nand many have underlying chronic\\nillnesses. Studies in a similar\\n\\nmemorable.\\nWhat a man brings home from the market determines the family diet.\\n\\nv.A\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\x0c14\\n\\nsetting suggest that on sick days,\\n\\nchildren in developing countries\\nconsume at least 20-30 percent\\nfewer calories, a deficit that is often\\nnot made up when the child\\nrecovers. Furthermore, cultural\\nbeliefs encourage the withholding\\nof food during illness. Programs to\\nprevent and control infections in\\nyoung children are likely to create a\\nmore positive feeding environment,\\nwith better food intakes, improved\\ngrowth, and more effective\\ncompliance with nutrition\\neducation.\\n\\n,\\n.\\n\\niN\\n.\\n\\n7. Promote formal and\\nnonformal education for\\n\\nDiscussing nutrition messages with village mnen.\\n\\nwomen.\\nInvestments in formal and\\nnonformal education for women\\nmay also be seen as supporting\\nimproved nutrition. Many studies\\nhave documented the link between\\nmaternal education and child\\nhealth. In this study, a woman\\'s\\nexposure to formal education, even\\nafter controlling for wealth, was a\\nsignificant predictor of the\\n\\nnutritional adequacy of her diet\\n(energy intake) and in the weaning\\nintervention, wa-s predictive of the\\nchild\\'s nutritional status and weight\\ngain.\\n\\n8. Engage fathers and other\\nfamily member. in the issues\\nof intrafamily food\\ndistribution.\\nTraditional adult diets in rural\\nBangladesh are already about as\\nlow cost as possible with over 80\\npercent of the calories from grain,\\nand little or no animal foods. In\\nthe families participating in this\\nstudy, all household members\\n\\nappeared to suffer from lack of\\nadequate food. Education to\\nchange food choices for women\\nwill likely be futile unless money is\\navailable to increase nutrition for all\\nfamily members. Thus, approaches\\nmust focus on all members of the\\nfamily, and not just on women and\\nchildren.\\nMan bartering bananas at village narket.\\n\\n..\\n\\n\\x0c15\\n\\nConclusions\\nAn evaluation of two nutrition\\neducation interventions in rural\\nBangladesh confirms that culturally\\xad\\nappropriate nutrition messages can\\nchange infant feeding practices and\\nimprove the nutritional status of\\nchildren. These changes can be\\naffordable, even to poor families.\\nHowever, the evaluation raises\\nconcerns about the effectiveness of\\nnutrition education in improving\\nwomen\\'s diets unless financial\\nbarriers are also addressed. For\\nboth women and children, existing\\npatterns of nutrition are intricately\\nconnected to cultural beliefs and\\npractices. Thus, designing effective\\nprograms requires attention to both\\ncultural and economic realities.\\n\\nPf\\n\\n\\x0c\\nUNICEF\\nPROGRAMMING\\nGUIDANCE\\n\\nImproving Young\\nChildren’s Diets During the\\nComplementary Feeding Period\\n\\nNUTRITION GUIDANCE SERIES\\n\\n\\x0cAcknowledgements\\n\\nThis publication was prepared by the Nutrition Section at UNICEF\\nProgramme Division in New York.\\nLead authors: Aashima Garg, France Bégin and Víctor Aguayo.\\nTechnical reviewers and contributors in UNICEF (in alphabetical order):\\nYousif Almasri, Yarlini Balarajan, Jessica Blankenship, Kudawashe Chimanya,\\nDavid Clark, Michael Emerson Gnilo, Chika Hayashi, Diane Holland, Ana Nieto,\\nAnne-Sophie Le Dain, Jo Jewell, Atif Khurshid, Julia Krasevec, Chessa Lutter\\n(consultant), Isabel Madzorera (consultant), Joan Matji, Vrinda R Mehra,\\nGrainne Mairead Moloney, Sheila Murthy (consultant), Reuel Kirathi Mungai,\\nZivai Murira, Louise Mwirigi, Mara Nyawo, Luwei Pearson, Christiane Rudert,\\nMawuli Sablah, Ruth Situma, Joseph Senesie, Harriet Torlesse, Megan Tucker,\\nVilma Tyler, Jessica White (consultant), Amirhossein Yarparvar,\\nand Noel Marie Zagre.\\nContributions were also gathered from governments and partner organizations\\nthrough regional consultations held for adapting the global action framework to\\nregional context in East Asia and the Pacific, Eastern and Southern Africa, and\\nSouth Asia.\\nUNICEF recognizes the support by the Government of the Netherlands\\nand the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the development of this\\nprogramme guidance.\\nEditor: Julia D’Aloisio\\nDesigner: Nona Reuter\\nCitation: United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

In addition,\\nlifelong food preferences, tastes and habits are often\\nestablished in childhood.\\nYet in nearly every part of the world, families face\\neconomic, political, market, social or cultural barriers\\nto providing nutritious, safe, affordable and sustainable\\ndiets to young children. These challenges are\\nexacerbated in humanitarian situations, where access\\nto nutritious food, clean drinking water, and good\\nquality health services are limited, and the resources\\nand capacities of caregivers already stretched. Young\\nchildren and their caregivers are increasingly exposed\\nto foods of low nutritive value, including commercial\\ncomplementary foods and processed foods high in\\nadded sugar, salt and saturated and trans fats that are\\ninexpensive, ubiquitous, and easy to feed to young\\nchildren. 3 Accelerating progress to improve the quality\\nof complementary foods and feeding practices for\\nyoung children is therefore critical.4\\n\\nThis Programming Guidance, Improving Young\\nChildren’s Diets During the Complementary Feeding\\nPeriod,* supports global efforts to improve the diets\\nof children aged 6–23 months in all contexts.** It is\\nintended for use by UNICEF staff in programmes such\\nas nutrition, health, early childhood development,\\nwater, sanitation and hygiene and social policy – in\\nregional, country and field offices – to support the\\nwork of governments and partner organizations.\\nPrevious UNICEF guidance on infant and young\\nchild feeding focused mainly on evidencebased interventions and strategies for improving\\ncomplementary feeding practices within the\\nhousehold.5 This Programming Guidance goes beyond\\nfeeding practices to articulate interventions and\\napproaches for improving the availability, accessibility,\\naffordability and consumption of nutritious and safe\\ncomplementary foods. In addition, this Programming\\nGuidance describes the most recent evidence on\\nimproving complementary feeding, explores the\\ndeterminants and drivers of young children’s diets, and\\npresents action frameworks for delivering nutrition\\nresults for children through the food, health, water\\nand sanitation, and social protection systems.

While children’s\\nstomachs can only hold a small amount of food, their\\nnutrient needs reach a lifetime peak,7 leaving them\\nvulnerable to growth faltering. In most countries,\\ndeclines in height-for-age or length-for-age (HAZ\\nor LAZ) occur primarily during the complementary\\nfeeding period (Figure 1)1, 8 due to the inadequate\\nquality and/or quantity of first foods, poor feeding\\npractices and increased rates of infection.9, 10\\nWhile first foods should be nutrient-rich, young\\nchildren are often fed meals based mainly on\\nstaple cereals and grains, which are low in energy,\\nprotein, iron, zinc and other essential nutrients.11-14\\nUnhygienic feeding practices also increase the risk\\nof infections and diarrhoea 4, 6 in young children,\\nwhich, when combined with poor diets, can lead to\\ngrowth failure.15\\nThe most recent global estimates of complementary\\nfeeding practices – based on indicators established\\nby WHO – highlight a worrying situation. In lowand middle-income countries, half of all children\\nare not receiving the minimum meal frequency\\n(the minimum number of meals throughout the\\nday needed to meet their nutrient needs); more\\nthan two thirds of children are not receiving the\\nminimum dietary diversity (meals from a minimum\\nnumber of food groups); and five out of six children\\nare not receiving a minimum acceptable diet (both\\nthe minimum meal frequency and minimum dietary\\ndiversity needed to reduce the risk of malnutrition)\\n(Figure 2).16 Diet quality is associated with nutrition\\nstatus: children who are fed at least a minimum\\n\\nacceptable diet are less likely to be stunted or\\nunderweight.17-19\\nDespite widespread consensus on the importance\\nof good nutrition in early life, an alarming number of\\nyoung children are suffering the consequences of\\npoor diets. At least one in three children under 5 is\\neither undernourished or overweight, according to\\nthe State of the World’s Children 2019: Children, food\\nand nutrition. Stunting affects 149 million children\\nunder 5 worldwide,4, 20 diminishing their physical\\nand cognitive growth and development.20 Children\\naffected by stunting often grow up to be stunted\\nadults themselves,21 and stunted mothers are more\\nlikely to have stunted children. Wasting affects more\\nthan 49 million children under 5 globally, putting them\\nat increased risk of infection and death.20, 22 Indeed,\\nundernutrition is responsible for up to 45 percent of\\ndeaths in children under 5 and is a significant cause\\nof morbidity in this age group.22 At the same time,\\nchildhood overweight impacts at least 40 million\\nchildren under 5, and is likely to continue rising in lowand middle-income countries, increasing the risk of\\nnon-communicable diseases in adulthood.20, 23, 24\\n\\nFigure 1: Growth faltering in height for age (HAZ) in\\nchildren coincides with the complementary feeding\\nperiod 8\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 9\\n\\n\\x0cPoor child growth in the first 1,000 days from\\nconception to age 2 predicts poorer survival 22, 25 and\\nincreases the risk of obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases in adulthood.

This section outlines what children should\\neat between the ages of 6 and 23 months; and when\\nand how they should be fed by their caregivers to\\nmeet their nutrient requirements for growth and\\ndevelopment.* It also outlines the key underlying\\nfactors that influence optimal feeding behaviours,\\nsuch as food availability, accessibility, affordability and\\nsustainability, and the supporting evidence regarding\\nthese dimensions.\\n3.1 WHAT CHILDREN E AT\\n\\nWHO and UNICEF recommend that infants be\\nexclusively breastfed from birth to 6 months of age.\\nAt 6 months, children should be introduced to ageappropriate, nutritious and safe complementary foods,\\nalongside continued breastfeeding. An adequate diet\\nduring the complementary feeding period should be\\nnutrient rich, without excess energy, saturated and\\ntrans fats, free sugars or salt.\\nAdequate diets for young children during\\nthe complementary feeding period are\\ncharacterized by:\\n3.1.1 Dietary diversity: Young children need to\\nconsume a variety of foods to meet their nutrient\\nneeds and expose them to various tastes and\\ntextures. A diverse diet includes meals consisting\\nof foods from a variety of food groups each day: (1)\\nbreastmilk; (2) grains, roots and tubers; (3) legumes,\\nnuts and seeds; (4) dairy (milk, yoghurt, cheese);\\n(5) flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, and liver or\\norgan meats); (6) eggs; (7) vitamin A-rich fruits and\\nvegetables (carrots, mangoes, dark green leafy\\nvegetables, pumpkins, orange sweet potato); and (8)\\nother fruits and vegetables. Children who are fed a\\n* At the time of publishing the Programming Guidance, discussions\\nare underway to update the WHO guiding principles for complementary feeding; however, few changes are expected following this update.\\n12\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\ndiverse range of foods are more likely to meet their\\nmicronutrient requirements, including the need for\\nvitamin A, iron, calcium, thiamine, folate, zinc, vitamins\\nB6 and B12.30-33\\n3.1.2 Nutrient density: Young children have limited\\nstomach capacity and must therefore eat small,\\nnutrient-rich meals to maximize the nutrition in each\\nbite. Examples of nutrient-dense local foods include\\nmeat, eggs and other animal-source foods and\\nlegumes, such as groundnuts. Cereals or plant-based\\nporridges may appease hunger, but alone they do not\\nprovide sufficient energy, protein and micronutrients to\\nfill the gap between breastmilk and the child’s nutrient\\nrequirements.34 The quality of fat in children’s diets is\\nimportant:35 Long-chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids –\\nespecially omega 3 fatty acids, which are found in fish\\n(such as trout, mackerel and sardines), seafood, nuts,\\nseeds, soy bean and plant oils – promote cognitive\\nand motor development in children.36 Trans fats, often\\nfound in processed foods, should be avoided given their\\nlink to inflammation in children and chronic diseases in\\nadults.37 Nutrient-rich and energy-rich foods should be\\nfed in age-appropriate and not excessive portions.\\n3.1.3 Inclusion of animal-source foods, vegetables\\nand fruits: Animal-source foods (such as eggs,\\nmeat, poultry, fish and dairy) are a good source of\\nhigh-quality protein and essential fatty acids and they\\nshould be introduced early, as some of the first foods\\nthat children eat. They are also an important source\\nof key nutrients, such as zinc, iron,** vitamin B12 and\\ncalcium.38, 39 Emerging evidence shows that the\\nconsumption of at least five food groups, including\\nanimal-source foods, is associated with a reduced\\nrisk of stunting in young children.19, 40 Fruits and\\nvegetables are vital components of a nutritious diet\\nand a rich source of vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre\\nand antioxidants.41 Consuming a variety of fruits and\\nvegetables daily helps ensure an adequate intake of\\nmany essential nutrients.\\n** With the exception of egg and dairy, which are not good sources of\\niron.\\n\\n\\x0c3.1.4 Inclusion of fortified foods or vitamin and\\nmineral supplements, as needed: While nutrientrich, home-prepared, and locally available foods are\\nalways preferable,42 it can be difficult to meet young\\nchildren’s nutrient needs in settings plagued by food\\ninsecurity or humanitarian crisis, and in settings with\\npredominantly vegetarian diets. In these contexts,\\nfoods fortified with vitamins and minerals that contain\\niron can fill nutrient gaps, and micronutrient powders\\n(MNPs) can be added to enhance the quality of foods\\nprepared at home (see section 5.4).43 Commercial\\nfortified foods for infants and young children (e.g.,\\nvitamin or mineral-enriched cereals) can also be an\\nimportant source of micronutrients in some contexts.\\nThe promotion of affordable fortified complementary\\nfoods should always be undertaken in line with\\nnational and global standards (i.e., the International\\nCode of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and\\nWHA Resolution 69.9).44\\n3.1.5 Avoidance of foods and beverages of low\\nnutrient value: Caregivers should avoid providing\\ndrinks or foods with low nutritional value, such\\nas sugar-sweetened beverages, candy, chips and\\nother foods high in sugar, salt and trans fats. These\\n‘junk’ foods contribute little more than energy, while\\ndisplacing breastmilk and decreasing the child’s\\nappetite for more nutritious foods. The consumption\\nof sugar-sweetened beverages by young children is\\nassociated with increased weight gain, body mass\\nindex (BMI) and risk of overweight and obesity.45\\nFruit juices, especially processed ones, should also\\nbe consumed in moderation as they are often rich in\\nadded sugars. Commercial complementary foods tend\\nto have the same (sweet) taste and texture, and when\\n\\nconsumed regularly, can make children less interested\\nin trying family foods and experiencing new tastes\\nand textures. Spotlight 1 presents growing evidence\\non the inappropriate promotion of commercial\\ncomplementary foods for young children.\\n3.1.6 Avoidance of added sugars: In many contexts,\\ncaregivers add sugar to foods and beverages prepared\\nat home to improve the taste. Sugar can contribute\\nto excess energy intake and cause dental caries. The\\nconsumption of sweet foods also contributes to a\\npreference for such foods, with the potential to set\\nlifelong taste preferences for sugar.\\n3.1.7 Continued breastfeeding: Children should\\ncontinue frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until\\n2 years of age or longer. Continued breastfeeding\\nthroughout the complementary feeding period\\nprovides essential fats, proteins and other nutrients\\nthat are important in all settings. Evidence shows\\nthat children aged 6–23 months who do not receive\\nbreastmilk have a higher risk of all-cause mortality and\\ninfection-related mortality compared with breastfed\\nchildren.46 Studies in high income countries have\\nshown that breastfeeding beyond 4 months of age is\\nassociated with a lower risk of child overweight and\\nobesity.47-49 Breastfeeding is also associated with\\nimproved cognitive development.50 Children who\\nare not breastfed during the complementary feeding\\nperiod should be fed dairy products such as animal\\nmilk, fermented milk or yoghurt. The use of follow-up\\nformulas or growing up milks are not necessary and\\nare often too high in sugars such as corn syrup solids\\nor other added caloric sweeteners.51\\n\\nWhat children should eat\\n\\nBreastmilk\\n\\nDiverse and\\nnutrient-dense foods\\nTo meet the minimum\\ndietary diversty, 5 of 8 food\\ngroups are required.\\n\\nAnimal-source\\nfoods, fruits and\\nvegetables\\n\\nFortified foods or\\nvitamins and\\nmineral\\nsupplements\\n\\nAvoid giving\\ndrinks or food with\\nlow nutrient value\\n\\nAvoid adding\\nsugars to home\\nprepared foods and\\nbeverages\\n\\n(as needed)\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 13\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight 1\\n\\nUnpacking the concerns\\nwith commercial foods\\nfor young children 52\\nSales of commercial baby and toddler\\nfoods have grown rapidly in recent\\nyears.53 The role of these products\\nin appropriate complementary\\nfeeding has been widely debated.54\\nHowever, there is a growing body\\nof evidence that the promotion of\\ncommercial foods for infants and young children has the potential undermine optimal nutrition during the\\ncomplementary feeding period. These concerns are summarized below:\\nNutritional composition\\nThe levels of saturated or transfats, free sugars and salt in\\nsome commercially-produced\\nbaby food is too high and may\\npredispose the child to noncommunicable diseases.55-62\\nArtificial sweeteners and other\\nfood additives in baby food are\\nalso linked with health concerns\\nas they may encourage greater\\nsugar consumption later in life.63\\nFlavour and texture\\nThe overwhelmingly sweet\\ntaste of commercial foods for\\nyoung children can influence\\nlater taste preferences and\\nhabits.64-66 Fruit puree is often the\\nmain ingredient in such foods,\\nand even ostensibly savoury or\\nvegetable-based products list\\nfruit as the first ingredient by\\nvolume. Given that the sweet\\nfruit flavours mask the taste\\nof the vegetable components,\\nit has been argued that a less\\nsweet product mix would help\\nbabies accept and like a wider\\nvariety of flavours. 34 Similarly,\\nthere are concerns about the\\nintroduction of salty tastes to\\nyoung palates, as well as flavours\\nnot typically used in homemade\\nfoods or recommended in dietary\\nguidelines for young children\\n(e.g. chocolate or vanilla).\\nThe provision of food in pouches\\ncan encourage children to\\nsuck the food directly from the\\nnozzle of the pouch (even if this\\nis not recommended by the\\n\\n14\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\nmanufacturer). The ease and\\nspeed of feeding in this way may\\ncause children to consume too\\nmany calories too quickly and\\ncould lead to dental caries.67\\nMany commercial baby and\\ntoddler foods are very smooth\\nin consistency.61 Because these\\nfoods are marketed without\\nan upper age limit, they do\\nnot encourage progression to\\nfoods with different textures.68\\nThey also lack the authentic\\ntaste, texture and appearance\\nof simple homemade foods and\\ncan negatively influence the\\nacceptance of such foods later in\\nchildhood.57\\nSome products on the market,\\nsuch as biscuits, wafers, puffs,\\nbars, bites and fruit shapes,\\nencourage snacking and their\\nmarketing often positions them\\nas an expected and appropriate\\npart of a child’s diet; however, in\\nmany ways, they are nutritionally\\nsimilar to confectionery. 34\\nInappropriate marketing\\nThe promotion of commercial\\nfoods for infants and young\\nchildren may undermine\\nexclusive and continued\\nbreastfeeding by encouraging\\nthe introduction of these foods\\nbefore 6 months of age or\\ninferring that they are superior\\nto breastmilk. Many products on\\nthe market indicate on the label\\nthat they are suitable for infants\\nyounger than 6 months and\\n\\ncontain a variety of nutrition and\\nhealth claims, which contravene\\nUNICEF/WHO recommendations\\nand Codex Alimentarius\\nguidelines.69 Some of these\\nproducts are marketed using\\nbrands, labels and packaging that\\nare very similar to those used for\\ninfant formula, thereby indirectly\\npromoting these breastmilk\\nsubstitutes (known as cross\\npromotion).\\nThe marketing of commercial\\nfoods for infants and young\\nchildren can undermine the value\\nof home-prepared foods (which\\nare usually less expensive),\\ndiscourage caregivers from\\nfeeding children a diverse diet,\\nand create dependency on\\ncommercial products. It can\\nalso undermine caregivers’\\nconfidence that a diet based on\\nhome-prepared foods will result\\nin the same health or educational\\noutcomes.\\nFurther information is available\\nin the WHO Guidance on Ending\\nthe Inappropriate Promotion\\nof Foods for Infants and Young\\nChildren (Spotlight 4).\\n\\n\\x0cWhen and how children should eat\\nAge-appropriate meal\\nfrequency\\n\\nTimely introduction of\\n“first foods”\\n\\nStarting at\\n\\n6 months\\n\\n2 or 3 times/day\\n\\n+\\n\\n2 to 3 spoonfuls Transition to 1/2 cup\\n3/4 cup\\n\\nSafe preparation, storage and use\\n\\nAge-appropriate food\\nconsistency\\n\\nAge-appropriate\\namounts\\n\\nResponsive feeding and caregiving\\n\\n1 cup\\n\\nFeeding during and after illness\\n\\n3.2.3 Age-appropriate amounts: Caregivers should\\nintroduce children to small amounts of food at first and\\nincrease the quantity of each meal gradually as the\\nchild gets older.

The appropriate\\nnumber of feedings depends on the energy density of\\nthe food and the quantities consumed at each feeding.\\nWHO recommends the following minimum meal\\nfrequency for an average healthy child:* 5, 70\\n• Two meals a day of solid, semi-solid or soft foods\\nfor breastfed infants aged 6–8 months;\\n• Three meals a day of solid, semi-solid or soft foods\\nfor breastfed children aged 9–23 months;\\n• Four meals a day of solid, semi-solid or soft foods\\n(or milk feeds) for non-breastfed children aged 6–23\\nmonths, of which at least one meal must include\\nsolid, semi-solid or soft food.33\\n\\n* Milk feeds are not included as a meal for breastfed children because the recommended frequency is based on an assumed average\\nbreastmilk intake. Caregivers can offer one or two healthy snacks to\\nthe child, such as a piece of fruit, while exercising caution to avoid\\ndisplacing breastmilk in the child’s diet.\\n\\n• Begin with 2–3 teaspoons of food and transition\\nto about ½ cup** per meal for children aged 6–8\\nmonths.\\n• Provide ½ cup per meal to children aged 9–11\\nmonths.\\n• Provide ¾ cup to 1 cup per meal to children aged\\n12–23 months.\\n3.2.4 Age-appropriate food consistency: The\\nconsistency of food should gradually evolve (from soft\\nto semi-solid to solid) with age, according to the child’s\\nrequirements and abilities. Young children move from\\neating mashed foods, to finger foods, to family foods\\nby the time they reach their first year. Inappropriate\\nconsistency can compromise nutrient intake, as\\nchildren may only be able to consume a trivial\\namount. At the same time, diluting complementary\\nfoods to reduce viscosity can also lower their energy\\ndensity,71 which is an increasing concern with the\\nrise of pureed food pouches (see Spotlight 1). While\\npureed foods are needed for children with special\\nneeds (e.g., those with disabilities or developmental\\ndelays that make eating and drinking difficult), in most\\ncases, the extended use of pureed foods can delay\\n** One cup of food is approximately 250 ml.\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 15\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight 2\\n\\nConsidering the needs of children and caregivers with disabilities\\nduring the complementary feeding period\\nMalnutrition can cause disabilities and disability can also lead to malnutrition, creating a vicious cycle.80\\nSome children with disabilities are more likely to be malnourished due to difficulties in swallowing and\\nfeeding, frequent illness, difficulties in absorbing nutrients, lack of caregiver knowledge on feeding, and\\nneglect.81\\nPhysical challenges with feeding may make\\nmealtimes longer and require assistive devices\\nand implements, such as mortars, food mills,\\nblenders and other manual food processors used to\\nmake soft pureed foods. Caregivers may therefore\\nrequire training and support to be able to feed their\\nchildren safely and appropriately. For example, a\\nstable, upright position with support for eating and\\ndrinking is one of the most important factors for\\nsafe swallowing. Wedged pillows or corner chairs,\\nmade by local carpenters, can facilitate this position\\nduring mealtimes. 82 Spoons and forks with a fold\\nor thicker handle are easier for children to hold and\\nbring to their mouths, while a plate with steep sides\\nmakes eating easier for children who are blind or\\nhave mobility limitations as the edges help push the\\nfood on to the spoon or fork.\\n\\nsuch as modified food consistency. 83 These barriers\\nare compounded when the caregiver also has a\\ndisability.\\n\\nChildren with disabilities are more likely to be\\noverlooked in mainstream programmes and\\nservices. Situational analysis should therefore\\nspecifically consider the needs and rights of\\nchildren with disabilities – with a systematic\\nexamination of the status, trends and determinants\\nof poor diets for children with disabilities – in order\\nto provide targeted support.\\nHouseholds headed by people with disabilities\\noften face barriers in accessing livelihoods and\\nincome-generating activities, affecting their\\nfood security and making it challenging to afford\\nnutritious complementary foods. To address these\\nsituations, social protection programmes should\\nbe targeted to include children and caregivers with\\ndisabilities. In addition, mobility may be limited for\\nsome children or caregivers living with disabilities,\\nrestricting their ability to seek services, information,\\ncounselling, and support, particularly where\\ncommunity extension services are limited.\\nCaregivers and children with disabilities in\\nhumanitarian crises face unique challenges. They\\nmay not benefit from food distributions, food-forwork, or livelihoods programmes, which further\\nlimits their access to nutritious food. Food rations\\nmay also not accommodate special feeding needs,\\n\\n16\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\nAshley, 19, holds her 18-month-old son Jaycean, who\\nhas cerebral palsy, at her grandmother’s home in\\nBelize. © UNICEF/UN0148774/Mendez\\n\\n\\x0cthe consumption of foods with varied textures and\\nconsistencies.72\\n3.2.5 Safe preparation, storage and use:\\nComplementary foods should be hygienically\\nprepared, stored and fed with clean hands, dishes\\nand utensils. Caregivers should wash their hands\\nwith soap and practice good hygiene (including safe\\ndisposal of child’s faeces) and proper food handling\\n(including separating raw and cooked food).73 Food will\\nspoil quickly after contact with germs; thus children\\nshould be fed from a separate serving dish, with any\\nleftovers discarded. Exposure to unsafe food and\\nwater increases the risk of microbial contamination\\nand leads to diarrhoea and nutrient loss. To avoid food\\nspoilage and contamination from insects, animals\\nand bacteria:\\n• Food should be covered;\\n• Cooked food should not be left at room\\ntemperature for more than two hours;\\n• Food should be stored at low temperature (below\\n5°C) and preferably refrigerated;74\\n• Raw and cooked food should be stored separately;\\n\\n3.2.7 Feeding during and after illness: Caregivers\\nshould increase children’s fluid intake during illness\\n(including by frequent breastfeeding) and encourage\\nthe child to eat (for example, by offering soft,\\nappetizing or favourite foods). After illness, caregivers\\nshould provide meals more frequently than usual\\nand encourage the child to eat more.18, 78 Children in\\nspecial circumstances (e.g., those with congenital\\nabnormalities, allergies and disabilities) who have\\nspecific dietary requirements and needs, will require\\ntailored support (see Spotlight 2).\\nChildren should have continued access to a nutritious\\nand safe diet, at an affordable price, and obtained\\nand prepared in a sustainable manner. Poor\\nfamilies spend a large proportion of their budget\\non food and may purchase low cost foods to afford\\nother household purchases. 79 In many settings,\\nunhealthy and nutrient-poor foods and snacks are\\nless expensive than healthy foods. Sustainable diets\\nare those that are accessible, culturally acceptable,\\naffordable, nutritionally, adequate and safe. They are\\nproduced from food systems that protect biodiversity\\nand ecosystems, while minimizing environmental\\ndegradation from food production.79 *\\n\\n• Raw fruits and vegetables should be washed with\\nclean water and stored in a cool place.\\n3.2.6 Responsive feeding and caregiving: Feeding\\nrequire a reciprocal relationship between children and\\ntheir caregivers. There are four stages of responsive\\nfeeding: (1) the child signals hunger or satiety through\\nactions and expressions; (2) the caregiver recognizes\\nthe cues; (3) the caregiver’s response is prompt,\\nnurturing, and developmentally appropriate; and,\\n(4) the child experiences the caregiver’s response.\\nResponsive feeding helps children develop selfregulation over food intake and facilitates their\\ntransition to eating independently.75 Social interactions\\nbetween caregiver and child (such as speaking to the\\nchild, singing, and encouraging him/her) also stimulate\\nconnections in the child’s brain and promote cognitive\\ndevelopment. Several studies have shown a positive\\nassociation between responsive feeding and improved\\nchild nutrition.76 Responsive feeding practices, where\\ncaregivers interact with the child and respond to his\\nor her hunger and satiety cues, have been found to\\nimprove children’s acceptance of food and adequate\\nfood intake.76, 77\\n\\n* This Programming Guidance highlights the importance of sustainable diets; however, it is beyond its scope to address this issue\\ncomprehensively. This area of work will be explored further in future\\neditions as UNICEF continues to develop its approach to delivering\\nsustainable diets through food systems.\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 17\\n\\n\\x0c4.\\n\\nDeterminants\\nand drivers of\\nyoung children’s\\ndiets during the\\ncomplementary\\nfeeding period\\n\\n18\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0cThe determinants of young children’s diets during\\nthe complementary feeding period include adequate\\ncomplementary foods, adequate complementary\\nfeeding practices, and adequate nutrition services\\n(Figure 3). These determinants are shaped by contextspecific factors – referred to as drivers.\\nTogether, the determinants and drivers of young\\nchildren’s diets determine children’s ability to enjoy\\nnutritious, safe, affordable and sustainable diets that\\nprotect, promote and support survival, growth and\\ndevelopment.\\n4.1 ADEQUATE FOODS\\n\\nThe adequacy of foods to improve young children’s\\ndiets is driven by the availability, access, affordability\\nand desirability of such foods.\\n4.1.1 Availability: Poor production, storage\\nand distribution of nutritious food reduces its\\navailability within households and markets and\\n\\nADEQUATE\\nFOODS\\n\\nGood diets\\nfor young\\nchildren\\n6–23 months\\n\\nFigure 3: Determinants of young children’s diets\\n\\nincreases its price.84 Vulnerabilities and shocks to\\nthe food system due to climate change, seasonal\\nfluctuations, diseases, conflicts, political instability,\\nunemployment and rising food prices can also impact\\nfood availability and livestock and crop production.85\\nThe limited availability of nutritious food is a barrier to\\nconsumption, even when caregivers can afford such\\nfoods.\\n4.1.2 Access: Long distances to markets, poor\\nroads and infrastructure, and humanitarian crises\\ncan make it difficult for families to access nutritious\\nfoods. Seasonality of production also impacts the\\navailability of nutritious and diverse foods.86-88 Conflict\\nmay impede access to production activities, such\\nas planting, harvesting and livestock movement.\\nChildren’s access to nutritious foods is also influenced\\nby food industry marketing and the presence\\nor absence of a protective policy environment\\n(Spotlight 4).\\n4.1.3 Affordability: Nutrient-rich foods – particularly\\nanimal-source foods – can be too costly for many\\nfamilies, leading to poor dietary diversity in children. 40,\\n89, 90\\nFortified complementary foods are also expensive\\nrelative to unfortified cereals.40 Household purchasing\\npower is often determined by income, intra-household\\nallocation of financial resources and the support\\nprovided by safety net programmes. Humanitarian\\ncrises can also significantly raise food prices by\\nlimiting food production and the supply of diverse\\nfoods.\\n4.1.4 Desirability: The increasing availability of lowcost processed and ultra-processed foods, snacks,\\nand sugar-sweetened beverages increases their\\ndesirability and consumption in children.91-93 Foods\\nof lower nutritional value often cost less per calorie\\nand tend to be selected by households with lower\\nsocioeconomic status.94, 95 Street foods and processed\\nfoods are convenient, low in nutrient quality, and\\nreadily available for those with limited time.96, 97\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 19\\n\\n\\x0c4. 2 ADEQUATE SERVICES\\n\\nHealth, nutrition, water and sanitation, and social\\nprotection services play a critical role in influencing\\nthe quality of children’s diets. The adequacy of these\\nservices is driven by their availability, affordability, use\\nand quality.\\n4.2.1 Availability, affordability and use of\\nhealth and nutrition services: Limited availability\\nof preventive and curative services within the\\nhealth system, such as nutrition counselling,\\nmicronutrient supplementation and the care of\\nsick children, can undermine complementary\\nfeeding practices and limit the use of such\\nservices by families.98, 99 Access to health and\\nnutrition services may be further reduced during\\nhumanitarian crises. Where health and nutrition\\nservices are available, high costs can deter their\\naccess and use.100 User fees can make child health\\nand nutrition services unaffordable to vulnerable\\nhouseholds, thereby limiting contact with the\\nhealth system and opportunities for counselling on\\ncomplementary feeding.\\n4.2.2 Quality of health and nutrition services: It\\nis not enough for services to be available; they must\\nalso be delivered with quality. High-quality nutrition\\ncounselling services to improve the diets of young\\nchildren require consistent delivery of messages\\nand support through multiple contact opportunities\\nwith caregivers.101, 102 Low-quality health and\\nnutrition services are ineffective in changing feeding\\nbehaviours and can reduce the demand for and\\nuse of these services by families.102 The limited\\nknowledge, inadequate skills and misconceptions\\nof health workers and inconsistent messaging\\ncan contribute to poor quality counselling.6, 99 The\\ncapacity of health workers to deliver quality services\\nis driven by multiple factors, including training\\nmethodology, supportive supervision, the availability\\nof tools and job aids, access to adequate human\\nresources, remuneration, regularity of payment\\nand workload.103\\n4.2.3 Availability, quality and use of social\\nprotection services: Social protection programmes\\ncan improve household purchasing power and\\nfood security, increasing the likelihood that\\nnutritious foods will be made available for young\\nchildren.104, 105 Such programmes for vulnerable\\n\\n20\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\nhouseholds are particularly important in times\\nof stress or shocks.106, 107 The provision of food\\nvouchers for households with children, for example,\\ncan provide vital support for improving children’s\\ndiets during emergencies.108 Social protection\\nprogrammes may also be used to incentivize the\\nuse of health and nutrition services. The quality of\\nsuch programmes is key: well-planned, designed\\nand implemented social protection programmes\\nare most effective at targeting vulnerable and food\\ninsecure households and influencing behaviours.\\n4.2.4 Availability, quality, affordability and use\\nof water and sanitation services: Access to basic\\nwater, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in the\\nhousehold, community and health facility improves\\nhygiene and sanitation behaviours and ensures the\\nsafety of complementary foods. The availability of\\ntoilet facilities, refuse collection, safe water and other\\nsanitation services reduces the risk of contaminating\\nfeeding utensils and complementary foods. In\\ncontrast, long distances to a safe water source and\\nhigh costs of water and sanitation services can limit\\naccess and force caregivers to use inferior services.\\n4.3 ADEQUATE PR ACTICES\\n\\nThe feeding, care and hygiene practices of caregivers\\nare key determinants of the quality of young children’s\\ndiets. These practices are driven by caregivers’\\nknowledge and time, household dynamics and social\\nnorms.\\n4.3.1 Caregiver knowledge: Caregivers’ knowledge\\nand behaviours on how to produce, store, process and\\nuse nutritious foods are an important determinant of\\nchildren’s diets.109 Lack of knowledge and experience\\nreduces caregivers’ ability to make appropriate food\\npurchasing decisions and limits their acceptance and\\nuse of diverse foods.110\\n4.3.2 Caregiver time: Work and household\\nresponsibilities constrain caregivers’ time and\\naffect their ability to prepare and feed nutritious\\nfoods at the recommended frequency. Women are\\nthe primary caregivers of young children in most\\ncontexts, and in many settings, their time is taken by\\nhousehold chores, such as fetching firewood or water,\\nagricultural labour, and other non-farm employment,\\nleaving limited time and energy for childcare. In\\nurban areas, working parents face important time\\n\\n\\x0cconstraints in preparing nutritious meals and\\nfrequently feeding their children. The choice\\nof complementary foods is therefore often\\nshaped by convenience and the desire to\\nbalance time for food preparation with other\\nhousehold demands.\\n4.3.3 Household dynamics: Children’s diets\\nare shaped by the distribution of food within\\nthe household, the prioritization of nutritious\\ndiets for children, women’s decision-making\\nin food purchasing, and gender preferences\\nin feeding children. The caregiver’s ability\\nto provide appropriate feeding and care to\\ntheir young child is also impacted by factors\\nsuch as stress, emotional well-being and\\nmental health).111 These intra-household\\ndynamics can be improved with support from\\nsocial protection programmes, interventions\\nto support caring of caregiver, as well\\nas through gender-sensitive health and\\nnutrition programmes that foster women’s\\nempowerment and men’s participation in\\nfeeding, care and child-rearing.112\\n4.3.4 Social norms: Social and cultural norms\\ninfluence what, when and how children are\\nfed.106, 113, 114 The knowledge, beliefs and\\nbehaviours of family members (particularly\\nmothers, fathers, grandmothers and older\\nwomen) strongly influence complementary\\nfeeding practices 115, 116 and the demand for\\nhealth services.\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 21\\n\\n\\x0c5.\\n\\nEvidence on\\nwhat works\\nfor improving\\nyoung children’s\\ndiets\\n\\n22\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0cThis section presents key interventions for improving\\nyoung children’s diets and describes their supporting\\nevidence base. Annex 1 synthesizes further evidence\\non the effectiveness of these interventions for\\nimproving child growth outcomes.\\n5.1 NUTRITION COUNSELLING AND\\nSOCIAL AND BEHAVIOUR CHANGE\\nCOMMUNICATION\\n\\nNutrition counselling and social and behaviour\\nchange communication (SBCC) involve the strategic\\nuse of communication approaches across a variety\\nof channels to promote changes in knowledge,\\nattitudes, norms, beliefs and behaviours.117 To date,\\nnutrition counselling and SBCC have been the\\nprimary approaches used to improve complementary\\nfeeding practices.\\nNutrition counselling and SBCC, provided alone or in\\ncombination with other interventions, are effective\\nin improving complementary feeding practices,\\ncaregiver knowledge on feeding practices and\\nnutrition outcomes.118, 119 They are also effective in\\nimproving dietary diversity, the consumption of ironrich foods, the consumption of a minimum acceptable\\ndiet and child growth outcomes (such as HAZ and\\nWAZ).99, 101, 120-124 While nutrition counselling and SBCC\\ncan improve complementary feeding outcomes, their\\neffectiveness depends on access to diverse and\\nnutritious foods at the household level.101\\nTo make an impact, nutrition counselling and SBCC\\nmust be intensive, sustained, action-oriented and\\nintegrated in routine health service delivery.99, 122\\nThis includes clear messages, delivered with\\nconsistency and desired intensity through multiple\\ncommunication channels. Spotlight 3 provides an\\noverview of evidence-based best practices supporting\\nnutrition counselling and SBCC to improve young\\nchildren’s diets.\\n\\n5. 2 COUNSELLING AND EDUCATION ON\\nRESPONSIVE FEEDING AND STIMUL ATION\\n\\nResponsive feeding happens when caregivers\\nencourage children to eat, provide food in response to\\ntheir appetite and satiety signals and feed them with\\ncare. Counselling on responsive feeding can promote\\nself-feeding, improve nutrient intake, and reduce the\\nrisk of undernutrition and overweight.77, 125, 126 Growth\\nand brain development depend on good nutrition,\\nstimulation and caregiver emotional responsiveness.\\nTherefore, supporting caregivers to use mealtime\\nas an opportunity for social interaction can improve\\nchild growth and development.76, 127 Further evidence\\nis needed to understand how response feeding\\ninterventions can be integrated and scaled-up as part\\nof complementary feeding programmes across diverse\\ncontexts, and how non-responsive feeding may\\ncontribute to child overweight.75, 128, 129\\n5.3 ACCESS TO DIVERSE AND NUTRITIOUS\\nCOMPLEMENTARY FOODS AT HOUSEHOLD\\nLEVEL\\n\\nInterventions to improve access to nutritious foods at\\nhousehold level are key to supporting optimal growth\\nand development in young children. In a study of one\\nhigh stunting context, providing one egg a day to\\nyoung children for a period of six months improved\\ntheir growth (LAZ and WAZ) and decreased stunting.130\\nA longitudinal follow-up after two years showed\\ncontinued reduction in growth faltering; however,\\nthe effects on linear growth were not sustained.131\\nIn other contexts, meat supplements132 and dietary\\nmodification (through the production and consumption\\nof animal-source foods and orange-red fruits such as\\npapayas and mangoes) improved dietary diversity. Such\\ninterventions also improved linear growth and reduced\\nanaemia and other micronutrient deficiencies.124 Further\\nevidence is needed from a range of programme\\nsettings to understand how these interventions can be\\nscaled-up to improve children’s diets.\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 23\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight 3\\n\\nBest practices for enhancing the effectiveness of nutrition counselling\\nand SBCC in improving young children’s diets\\n\\uf030 Identify priority\\ncomplementary feeding\\nbehaviours using formative\\nresearch and qualitative\\napproaches to understand\\nunderlying determinants\\nof poor diets and feeding\\npractices, access to nutritious\\nand affordable complementary\\nfoods, and key influencers of\\nbehaviours.\\n\\n\\uf030 Design interventions and\\nprioritize actions to address key\\nbarriers to quality diets for young\\nchildren.\\n\\n\\uf030 Test key programming\\napproaches, messages, training\\nand communication content,\\nand tools for feasibility,\\nacceptability and clarity, prior to\\nimplementation at scale.\\n\\n\\uf030 Select multiple\\ncommunication channels to\\ndeliver consistent messages\\nand achieve desired coverage,\\nquality, intensity, and scale; 99\\n\\n24\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\nintegrate existing tools (e.g.,\\nfirst foods videos) and use of\\ninnovative approaches (e.g.,\\ndigital and social media), where\\nfeasible.\\n\\n\\uf030 Align key messages into the\\ncapacity development of service\\nproviders, frontline workers,\\nand other key influencers\\nat household, community\\nand facility levels, targeting\\nboth technical and functional\\ncapacities; and conduct\\ncontinued needs assessments,\\nsupportive supervision and\\nmonitoring.\\n\\n\\uf030 Begin counselling and\\nSBCC before children reach 6\\nmonths of age to address the\\ntimely introduction of food\\nand continue age-appropriate\\nmessages until 24 months of age,\\nincluding with family members\\nwho are involved in feeding or\\ninfluence the food and household\\nenvironment.\\n\\n\\uf030 Conduct nutrition\\ncounselling in individual or\\ngroup settings and include\\nfeeding demonstrations and\\nopportunities for peer-to-peer\\nproblem-solving (e.g., via mother\\nsupport groups).\\n\\n\\uf030 Promote collaboration among\\npaid health staff, frontline\\nworkers and volunteers to\\nachieve the desired number of\\ncounselling contacts.\\n\\n\\uf030 Implement nutrition\\ncounselling and SBCC in\\nconjunction with other evidencebased interventions, such\\nas food-based approaches\\nor systems strengthening\\ninterventions.\\n\\n\\uf030 Sustain comprehensive\\nnutrition counselling and\\nSBCC approaches for at least\\ntwo years, with continuous\\nmonitoring and adjustments,122\\nand document learnings.\\n\\n\\x0cEnhancing agricultural production of nutritious foods\\nis another way to improve access to diverse children’s\\ndiets. Support through agricultural inputs and extension\\nservices, small livestock production and homestead\\nfood production has shown to improve the availability\\nof nutritious and safe complementary foods.84, 133,\\n134\\nAgricultural production alone may be insufficient\\nto improve child nutrition outcomes; however, when\\ncombined with nutrition counselling, SBCC, home visits\\nand food demonstrations, agricultural interventions\\ncan improve caregiver knowledge, enhance feeding\\npractices, and increase the likelihood of children\\nreceiving the minimum acceptable diet.84, 135, 136 These\\ninterventions have also been shown to improve young\\nchildren’s growth, haemoglobin levels, and nutrient\\nintake.133, 135-137\\n5.4 USE OF VITAMIN AND MINER AL\\nSUPPLEMENTS IN SET TINGS WHERE\\nNUTRIENT- POOR DIETS PREVAIL\\n\\nWhen integrated into programmes to improve\\ncomplementary feeding, vitamin and mineral\\nsupplements such as MNPs, can be added to home\\nprepared foods to enhance the quality of children’s\\ndiets by providing adequate nutrients to prevent\\nmicronutrient deficiencies.* WHO recommends home\\nfortification with iron containing MNPs for young\\nchildren in settings where nutrient-rich foods are\\ninaccessible or unaffordable, or where the prevalence\\nof anaemia in children is greater than 20 percent.138\\nThe integration of MNPs into IYCF programmes\\nshould always be coupled with counselling on its use\\nand nutrition education to improve complementary\\nfeeding practices.\\nThere is a strong evidence to support the effectiveness\\nof MNPs in preventing anaemia and iron deficiency\\nin children aged 6–23 months.139-143 MNP integration\\ninto IYCF programmes has been shown to incentivize\\nparticipation,144 increase caregiver knowledge on\\nappropriate complementary feeding,142, 145 improve the\\nconsistency of complementary foods,146, 147 facilitate\\ntimely initiation of solid foods at 6 months of age,\\nimprove dietary diversity, and improve population-based\\nfeeding indicators.142, 148 It may also increase linear\\ngrowth in children.149 Implementation strategies for\\nMNPs should be not be implemented in isolation and\\n* Some countries may integrate the use of other mineral and vitamin\\nsupplements such as multiple micronutrient syrups or chewable\\ntablets for young children in their programmes; however, this is not\\ncovered in the Programming Guidance.\\n\\nintegrated into all areas of IYCF programming, including\\npolicy development, formative research, delivery\\nmechanisms, SBCC, and monitoring and evaluation\\nto ensure they reinforce appropriate complementary\\nfeeding practices.150\\n5.5 ACCESS TO FORTIFIED FOODS AS\\nNEEDED, ALIGNED WITH GLOBAL AND\\nNATIONAL STANDARDS\\n\\nFortified foods can improve complementary feeding\\nand children’s nutritional status in settings where\\nnutrient-poor diets are common and access to\\ndiverse foods is limited.7 Promoting access to fortified\\ncomplementary foods with or without nutrition\\ncounselling can improve children’s linear growth in\\nfood-insecure settings,123 though more evidence is\\nneeded from food-secure settings. Fortified blended\\nfoods containing locally available cereals and pulses\\n(such as a corn-soya blend), have shown to be\\nparticularly effective in humanitarian response.151, 152 The\\nprovision of specialized fortified products, such as small\\nquantity-lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS), in\\ncombination with nutrition counselling and SBCC, may\\nalso improve feeding practices, though their impact on\\nimproving dietary diversity is limited.153 Recent evidence\\nfrom low- and middle-income countries154 suggests that\\nSQ-LNS, in combination with complementary feeding,\\nhave the potential to improving growth outcomes\\n(stunting, wasting and underweight) and anaemia\\namong young children. These products are costly,\\nhowever, and their integration into routine programming\\nmay be cost prohibitive.\\nInterventions to improve access to fortified\\ncomplementary foods should be implemented in line\\nwith international and national regulations, including\\nthe International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk\\nSubstitutes and relevant WHA resolutions, and the\\n2016 Guidance on Ending Inappropriate Promotion of\\nFoods for Infants and Children (Spotlight 4).\\n5.6 ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND\\nNUTRITIOUS FOODS THROUGH SOCIAL\\nPROTECTION PROGR AMMES AND\\nCOUNSELLING SERVICES\\n\\nSocial protection programmes can improve access\\nto affordable and nutritious complementary foods\\nand nutrition counselling services among vulnerable\\nhouseholds. Nutrition-sensitive social protection\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 25\\n\\n\\x0cservices, such as cash transfers, integrated\\nmicrocredit, and nutrition education can improve\\nhousehold food security, dietary diversity and caregiver\\nempowerment.105, 155 They also address some of the\\nbasic causes of child malnutrition by narrowing the gaps\\nin economic access and promoting women’s decisionmaking. Certain types of social protection programmes,\\nsuch as cash transfers, can increase the household\\nbudget for food purchase, which in turn influences what\\nchildren eat.156 In humanitarian situations, cash transfers\\ncan prevent negative coping responses to food scarcity\\n(such as reducing the number of meals per day),\\nimprove dietary intake and access to diverse foods for\\nchildren.157\\nThe integration of nutrition counselling and SBCC\\nwithin social protection programmes is critical to\\nensure that the resources provided to the household\\nare used to improve the diets of young children.\\nCommon approaches include combining cash\\ntransfers with nutrition counselling,158, 159 and providing\\nfortified foods, curative and preventive health services\\n(such as immunizations), growth promotion,160 wellchild visits,161 and MNPs.158\\n5.7 ACCESS TO SAFE WATER AND CLE AN\\nHOUSEHOLD ENVIRONMENTS FOR YOUNG\\nCHILDREN\\n\\nNutrition counselling and SBCC on the recommended\\nfeeding practices, together with access to basic\\nWASH services at household level, can improve\\ncaregiver knowledge of the recommended hygiene\\nand sanitation behaviours and decrease faecal\\ncontamination of complementary foods.162-165\\nEvidence shows that community-level sanitation\\naccess has a greater impact on nutrition outcomes\\nthan household level access.166 As such, communitywide WASH-nutrition approaches may be critical to\\nsignificantly reduce environmental contamination to\\nimprove children’s diets. It is vital to understand which\\nof the fecal-oral routes are most relevant in a given\\ncontext and ensure they are adequately targeted in\\nprogramme design. Additional evidence is needed\\nfrom implementation research and programme\\nsettings to understand the most effective design and\\nscale-up of such integrated programmes.\\n\\n26\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight 4\\n\\nAddressing the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and\\nyoung children\\nIn 2016, WHO developed Guidance on ending the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young\\nchildren . 44, 167 The Guidance covers all commercially produced foods and beverages that are marketed as\\nsuitable for feeding children aged 6–36 months. Products are considered to have been “marketed as suitable”\\nfor this age group if they:\\n•\\n\\nare labelled with the words\\nbaby/babe/infant/toddler/\\nyoung child;\\n\\n•\\n\\nrecommend an age of\\nconsumption of less than\\n3 years;\\n\\n•\\n\\nuse an image of a child that\\nappears to be 3 years of age\\nor younger or is feeding with a\\nbottle; or\\n\\n•\\n\\nare in any other way\\nrepresented as suitable for\\nchildren under the age of 3\\nyears.\\n\\nThe Guidance defines ‘promotion’\\nas the communication of\\nmessages that are designed\\nto persuade or encourage the\\npurchase or consumption of a\\nproduct or raise awareness of a\\nbrand. This includes advertising\\nactivities and materials, nonadvertising promotions (such as\\nspecial displays, sales, discount\\ncoupons and rebates, lossleaders and tie-in sales), and\\nlabelling, packaging and claims.\\n\\nThe Guidance provides seven\\nrecommendations:\\n1. Optimal infant and young child\\nfeeding should be promoted\\nbased on the guiding principles\\nfor complementary feeding and\\nfeeding non-breastfed children\\naged 6–24 months, with an\\nemphasis on nutrient-rich, homeprepared and locally available\\nfoods.\\n2. Products that function as\\nbreastmilk substitutes should not\\nbe promoted.\\n3. Foods for infants and young\\nchildren that do not function as\\nbreastmilk substitutes should\\nbe promoted only if they\\nmeet all the relevant national,\\nregional and global standards\\nfor composition, safety, quality\\nand nutrient levels, and are\\nin line with national dietary\\nguidelines.\\n4. The messages used to promote\\nfoods for infants and young\\nchildren should support optimal\\nfeeding and should not include\\ninappropriate messages.\\n\\n5. There should be no crosspromotion of breastmilk\\nsubstitutes indirectly via the\\npromotion of foods for infants\\nand young children.\\n6. Companies that market foods\\nfor infants and young children\\nshould not create conflicts of\\ninterest in health facilities or\\nthroughout health systems.\\nHealth workers, health systems,\\nhealth professional associations\\nand non-governmental\\norganizations should avoid such\\nconflicts of interest.\\n7. The WHO set of\\nrecommendations on the\\nmarketing of foods and nonalcoholic beverages to children168\\nshould be fully implemented,\\nwith particular attention to\\nensuring that settings where\\ninfants and young children\\ngather are free from all forms of\\nmarketing of foods high in fats,\\nsugars or salt.\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 27\\n\\n\\x0c6.\\n\\nAction\\nframework to\\nimprove the\\ndiets of young\\nchildren\\nduring the\\ncomplementary\\nfeeding period\\n\\n28\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0cImproving young children’s diets requires countries\\nto deliver programmes grounded in evidence-based\\ninterventions (described in section 5) at scale,\\nwith quality and equity. To achieve the desired\\nimpact, such interventions must be designed and\\nimplemented to respond to the context-specific\\ndrivers of children’s diets. These interventions will be\\nimplemented through one or more systems – food,\\nhealth, water and sanitation, and social protection\\n(explored further in section 6.2).\\nThe Action Framework to Improve the Diets of Young\\nChildren During the Complementary Feeding Period\\n(hereafter referred to as the Action Framework) is\\na tool for facilitating programming to improve the\\ndiets of children aged 6–23 months. Applying the\\nAction Framework facilitates a systematic analysis\\nof the context-specific drivers of poor diets during\\nthe complementary feeding period and prioritizes\\nstrategic actions for addressing them through\\nrelevant systems (Figure 4). The Action Framework\\nenables UNICEF staff serving in regional and country\\noffices to support governments and partners in\\nthe design, implementation and monitoring of\\nevidence-based programmes to improve the diets of\\nyoung children.\\n6.1 ELEMENTS OF THE ACTION\\nFR AMEWORK\\n\\nThe Action Framework has seven elements that\\ninterplay to facilitate the design and implementation\\nof evidence-based programmes. This section\\ndescribes these elements and how they contribute\\nto the outcome of nutritious, safe, affordable and\\nsustainable diets (i.e. good diets) for young children.\\n\\n6.1.1 Situation analysis to understand the status\\nand drivers of young children’s diets\\nSituation analysis is the first step to designing an\\nevidence-based programme. A sound situation\\nanalysis helps the country team identify the contextspecific drivers of children’s diets and prioritize\\nstrategic actions. Situation analysis for complementary\\nfeeding programmes entails a systematic examination\\nof the status, trends and drivers of poor diets for\\nyoung children. It should be informed by a review\\nof quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from\\nDemographic Health Surveys, National Nutrition\\nSurveys, other national and local surveys and\\nstudies), the policy environment, existing programme\\nservice delivery, and interviews with stakeholders\\nin government, UN agencies and non-governmental\\norganizations.\\n\\nBarriers to nutritious diets should be assessed through\\na market analysis of locally available foods, including\\ntheir availability and promotion, and public perceptions\\nof commercially produced complementary foods (see\\nAnnex 3 and 4). A mapping of country stakeholders\\nand partnerships is a vital component of the situation\\nanalysis, which should be undertaken through a\\nconsensus building process with the government\\nand partners. Engaging national stakeholders in this\\nprocess promotes national ownership and programme\\nsustainability.\\nEvidence on food consumption patterns, cost of\\ndiets and nutrient gap analyses for children aged\\n6–23 months should also be reviewed to understand\\nthe magnitude of dietary limitations.169-171 Annex 2\\ndescribes some of the tools available to aid such\\nanalyses. In emergency contexts, it is also important\\nto understand pre-existing nutrient gaps versus those\\nthat have been exacerbated by the situation. There\\nis also a need to understand the risks inherent in\\nemergency contexts and identify the actions needed\\nto strengthen systems or enhance preparedness to\\nensure that programmes can scale up or down in\\nresponse (see Spotlight 7).\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 29\\n\\n\\x0c30\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\nInstitutional Level\\n(Public & Private)\\n\\nImprove the\\navailability,\\nquality,\\naffordability\\nand use of safe\\ndrinking water,\\nhygiene and\\nsanitation\\nservices and\\npractices for\\nyoung children\\n\\nWATER &\\nSANITATION\\nSYSTEM\\n\\nCommunity/Household/\\nIndividual Level\\n\\nImprove the\\navailability,\\nquality,\\naffordability and\\nuse of adequate\\nfoods and\\nservices for\\nyoung children\\n\\nSOCIAL\\nPROTECTION\\nSYSTEM\\n\\nM O N I T O R I N G , E VA L UAT I O N & L E A R N I N G\\n\\n(Food securit y situation, humanitarian crisis, political and economic instabilit y, etc.)\\n\\nPROGRAMMING CONTEXT\\n\\nPolicy\\nLevel\\n\\nImprove the\\navailability,\\nquality,\\naffordability\\nand use of\\nhealth and\\nnutrition\\nservices for\\nyoung children\\n\\nImprove the\\navailability,\\naccess,\\naffordability\\nand desirability\\nof diets for\\nyoung children\\n\\nWITH ACTIONS\\nAT THE:\\n\\nHEALTH\\nSYSTEM\\n\\nFOOD\\nSYSTEM\\n\\nS T R AT E G I C AC T I O N S D E L I V E R E D T H R O U G H SYS T E M S\\n\\nFigure 4: Action Framework to Improve the Diets of Young Children during the Complementary Feeding Period\\n\\nAssess critical gaps,\\nbot tlenecks and barriers\\n\\nADEQUATE\\nPRACTICES\\n\\nADEQUATE\\nSERVICES\\n\\nADEQUATE\\nFOODS\\n\\nDETERMINANTS\\n\\nAction Framework to Improve the Diets of Young Children\\nDuring the Complementary Feeding Period\\n\\nSITUATION ANALYSIS\\n\\nchildren\\n\\nnutritious, safe,\\naffordable and\\nsustainable\\ndiets for young\\n\\nImproved access to\\nand consumption of\\n\\n6–23 months\\n\\nGood diets\\nfor young\\nchildren\\n\\nOUTCOME\\n\\n\\x0cSituation Analysis\\n\\nReview of qualitative and quantitative data\\n\\n1.\\n\\n2.\\n\\n3.\\n\\n4.\\n\\n5.\\n\\n6.\\n\\n7.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nComplementary\\nfeeding indicators\\n(Status, trends and\\npredictors)\\n\\nStakeholders\\nmapping\\n\\nProgramme service\\ndelivery\\n\\nPolicy landscape of\\nhealth, nutrition, social\\nprotection and agriculture sectors (Others as\\nrelevant)\\n\\nFood consumption\\npatterns, nutrient\\ngaps and cost of diet\\n\\nBarriers to access of\\nadequate complementary\\nfoods – in markets and at\\nhousehold level\\n\\nKnowledge, attitudes\\nand practices\\n\\nComposition and\\nmarketing of locally and\\ncommercially prepared\\ncomplementary foods\\n\\nFigure 5: Core components of situation analysis for programmes to improve the diets of young children\\n\\nThe core components of a complementary feeding\\nsituation analysis are illustrated in Figure 5.

These\\ndeterminants are driven by contextual factors (i.e.\\ndrivers), that enable or inhibit a child’s access to and\\nregular consumption of nutritious, safe, affordable and\\nsustainable diets.\\n\\nSituation analysis in a country may highlight the lack\\nof access to diverse foods at household level as a\\nkey determinant of inadequate child diets. A more\\nin-depth analysis may reveal that national policies are\\nnot addressing children’s needs, gaps in institutional\\ncapacity are restricting service delivery, the lack of\\nfood-based dietary guidelines is limiting the production\\nof diverse foods, and women’s role in agriculture is\\nrestricting their time for child feeding and care.\\n\\nAn in-depth analysis of the gaps, bottlenecks and\\nbarriers to adequate foods, services and practices is\\ncritical to explore why young children’s diets are not\\nimproving in a particular context. This process should\\nideally be built into the country situation analysis and\\nshould consider: (1) the policy environment (policies,\\nlegislation, multisectoral collaboration, accountability);\\n(2) the institutional capacity to plan, finance and\\nimplement; and (3) behaviours at household level\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 31\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight 5\\n\\nSystems-strengthening to improve the diets of young\\nchildren\\nSystems-strengthening is a guiding\\nprinciple of UNICEF programming in\\nall contexts. It involves developing the\\ngovernment’s institutional capacity to\\ndeliver and monitor actions to improve\\nchildren’s diets, including through\\nsupport to expand human resource\\ncapacity, improve service delivery,\\n\\ndevelop standards and guidelines,\\nestablish information and accountability\\nsystems, and improve governance and\\nfinancing. When systems-strengthening\\nefforts continue during emergencies they\\ncan promote community resilience and\\nhelp institutionalize actions to improve\\nchildren’s diets over the long-term.\\n\\n6.1.3 Implementing strategic actions through\\nsystems\\nImplementing strategic actions to achieve the\\noutcome of good diets for young children will require\\nUNICEF to influence and leverage the potential of\\nfour systems: food, health, water and sanitation, and\\nsocial protection. Section 6.2 explores these systemspecific actions in further detail.\\n\\nStrategic actions address the context-specific gaps,\\nbottlenecks and barriers to good diets for young\\nchildren. In prioritizing strategic actions, UNICEF\\ncountry offices should consider the evidencebased interventions for improving young children’s\\ndiets, the programming context (described below),\\nUNICEF’s comparative advantage, human and\\nfinancial resources, access to resources in the\\ncountry, and the activities planned by partners\\nand stakeholders.\\nThe actions prioritized at country level should be\\nspecific, costed, and include accountabilities for\\ndifferent stakeholders, including government and\\npartners. This should occur through a consultative\\nprocess, preferably via national nutrition coordination\\nplatforms such as the Scaling Up Nutrition\\nmovement and Nutrition Cluster platforms.\\nAt policy level, actions may involve advocating for\\npolicies, legislation, plans, budgets, coordination,\\npartnerships and accountability mechanisms\\nfor improving young children’s diets. These are\\nessential building blocks for a strengthened enabling\\nenvironment that can catalyse change at country\\nlevel (see Spotlight 6).\\n\\n32\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\nAt institutional level, actions may involve systemsstrengthening to boost the government’s institutional\\ncapacity to deliver and monitor evidence-based\\nactions to improve children’s diets (see Spotlight 5).\\n6.1.4 Programming context\\nThe programming context is defined as the setting in\\nwhich the country programming is being implemented.\\nIt takes into account contextual features such as food\\ninsecurity, emergencies, urbanization, and political\\nand economic instability. Spotlight 7 illustrates how\\nfood insecurity, humanitarian crises, and the double\\nburden of malnutrition can influence the prioritization\\nof strategic actions at country level.\\n6.1.5 Monitoring, evaluation and learning\\nMonitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) is central\\nto the design and implementation of complementary\\nfeeding programmes. Further details are provided in\\nSection 7.\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight 6\\n\\nThe building blocks of an enabling environment for improving young\\nchildren’s diets\\nSupportive policy and legal frameworks\\nA policy landscape analysis is an important first\\nstep in identifying gaps in the policies and legal\\nframeworks driving complementary feeding\\noutcomes and advocating with the government\\nto address them (Annex 3). Providing technical\\nsupport to government is also critical to\\nformulating comprehensive national policies\\nand legislation, and implementing, monitoring,\\nenforcing and evaluating them.\\n\\nfeeding practices and address them through\\nSBCC. Key components of social change\\ninclude sustainability through local ownership;\\nempowering communication; an emphasis\\non dialogue, debate, and negotiation; and an\\nemphasis on communities and families as the\\nagents of their own change.\\n\\nStrengthened institutional coordination\\nImproving young children’s diets requires\\ncoordinated service delivery across sectors,\\nsuch as health, agriculture, social protection,\\nwater and sanitation, and the private sector.\\nThis entails strengthening multisectoral plans,\\nbudgets and coordination, together with\\nstakeholder mapping and clearly defining the\\nroles and accountabilities of government and\\nnon-state actors in accomplishing planned\\noutcomes.\\nLeveraging financial resources\\nImproving young children’s diets will require\\nleveraging financial resources to implement\\npriority actions at national and decentralized\\nlevels across relevant sectors. This entails\\nadvocacy and technical support to the\\ngovernment in developing costed actions plans\\nand advocacy with partners to invest in relevant\\nactions at national and sub-national level.\\nStrengthened results-based programme\\ndesign and implementation\\nProviding technical support to a range of\\ngovernment departments can help strengthen\\nnational plans, strategies, budgets and\\nmonitoring systems for improving young\\nchildren’s diets. This includes fostering\\ncoherence and linkages across sector plans,\\nstrategies and budgets directed towards a\\ncommon nutrition outcome.\\nUnderstanding and shifting social and cultural\\nnorms around young child feeding\\nImproving young children’s diets also\\ninvolves examining and attempting to shift\\nharmful social and cultural norms, including\\nthose related to gender roles and the stigma\\nattached to disability. A situation analysis\\ncan help identify the critical social norms,\\nbeliefs and taboos hindering adequate child\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 33\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight 7\\n\\nPrioritizing strategic actions according to programme context\\nA. Food insecurity\\nFood security – measured\\nthrough food availability,\\naccessibility, use and the\\nstability of these dimensions\\nover time – is an underlying\\ndeterminant of poor diets in\\nyoung children. 85 Food insecurity\\ncan be chronic or transitory,\\nand may persist through\\ndroughts, famines, localized food\\nshortages, high food prices and\\nseasonal variations.172\\nProgrammes designed in the\\ncontext of food insecurity should\\nfocus on removing barriers to\\nthe availability, access, and\\nuse of affordable, nutritious\\nfoods, taking into consideration\\nseasonal fluctuations and\\nthe capacity of systems to\\ndeliver. Actions may include\\nimproving options for storage,\\nprocessing and packaging of\\nnutrient-rich foods, stimulating\\nfood production during lean\\nmonths (e.g., through homebased gardening), providing\\nfortified foods or vitamin and\\nmineral supplements, and\\nstrengthening linkages with\\nsocial protection programmes\\nand nutrition counselling.\\nB. Humanitarian crises\\nHumanitarian situations are\\ncharacterized by limited access\\nto safe food and clean water\\nand a breakdown in basic health\\nservices.173 Security challenges,\\n\\nstress, lack of access to cooking\\nfuel, and poor access to a\\nclean environment may affect\\ncaregivers’ ability to provide safe\\nand nutritious complementary\\nfoods to children. Improving\\nchildren’s diets during\\nemergencies requires a response\\ngrounded in sound situation\\nanalysis, systems with the\\ncapacity to deliver, and available\\nresources. The approach should\\ninvolve building institutional\\ncapacity and supporting the\\ngovernment to mitigate the\\neffect of humanitarian crisis and\\nfacilitate sustainable recovery.\\nIn sudden onset emergencies,\\nimmediate responses may\\ninclude provision of food\\nassistance, safe drinking\\nwater, and cooking equipment.\\nIn cases of migration, the\\nprovision of nutrient-rich\\ncomplementary foods through\\nonsite supplementary feeding\\nprogrammes and the distribution\\nof food rations for households\\nwith young children may be\\nprioritized. In economic and slow\\nonset emergencies, ensuring\\nsustained access to nutritious\\nand healthy complementary\\nfoods may require reliance\\non cash transfers (or similar\\nprogrammes), which can be used\\nto increase household resources\\nfor food and improve access to\\nnutrition services.\\n\\nC. The double burden of\\nmalnutrition\\nThe double burden of\\nmalnutrition* has led to a shift\\ntowards diets characterized by\\nrefined and processed foods that\\nare high in sugar, fat and salt, and\\nlow in nutrient density.174 This in\\nturn has led to increased caloric\\nconsumption, especially in urban\\nareas in low- and middle-income\\ncountries, resulting in rising rates\\nof childhood overweight, obesity\\nand micronutrient deficiencies.\\nSituation analysis should\\nassess both undernutrition and\\noverweight-related drivers and\\ntheir distribution by geographic\\nlocation, socio-economic status,\\nand sex. Policies to address the\\ndouble burden may focus on\\nregulating the nutrient content\\nof commercial complementary\\nfoods to align with food-based\\ndietary guidelines. Further, the\\npromotion of diversified diets\\ncan prevent both overweight\\nand undernutrition in children.\\nCountries should also consider\\npolicies to improve the external\\nfood environment (such as\\nsugar-sweetened beverage\\ntaxes), which can decrease\\nthe risk of overweight. Finally,\\nunderstanding the drivers of\\ncaregiver decisions to purchase\\nunhealthy food is critical.\\n\\n* The double burden refers to the simultaneous existence of multiple forms of undernutrition and overweight within individuals, households and\\npopulations at various points across the life course.\\n\\n34\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0cLeveraging the power of multiple systems in\\nachieving good diets\\n\\nDELIVERY\\nSYSTEMS\\n\\nFOOD\\nSYSTEM\\n\\nOUTCOME\\n\\nHEALTH\\nSYSTEM\\n\\nGood diets\\nfor young\\nchildren\\naged 6–23 months\\n\\nWATER &\\nSANITATION\\nSYSTEM\\n\\nImproved access to\\nand consumption of\\n\\nnutritious, safe,\\naffordable and\\nsustainable\\ndiets for young\\n\\nSOCIAL\\nPROTECTION\\nSYSTEM\\n\\nchildren\\n\\n6. 2 DELIVERING STR ATEGIC ACTIONS\\nTHROUGH SYSTEMS\\n\\nFor UNICEF, a systems approach aims to leverage\\nthe potential of food, health, water and sanitation,\\nand social protection systems* and make them more\\naccountable for delivering nutrition results for young\\nchildren. Rather than simple coordination among\\nsystems, a systems approach requires a shared vision,\\njoint planning and monitoring. Leveraging the power of\\nmultiple systems expands the number of opportunities\\nto reach children and improve their diets in a more\\ncomprehensive and systematic way. Indeed, each\\nsystem has a role to play in achieving the outcome of\\ngood diets for young children (Figure 4).\\nThe Action Framework can be applied to each of\\nthe four systems to identify strategic actions to\\naddress the drivers of children’s diets. Depending on\\nthe country-specific drivers, strategic actions, and\\nprogramming context, the country should identify\\nwhich system(s) need to be leveraged to accomplish\\nthe outcome of good diets for young children.\\n\\nFor example, improving dietary diversity requires\\na food system that can produce diverse local\\nfoods that are accessible to households; a health\\nsystem with staff at facility and community level\\nto provide education and counselling on optimal\\ncomplementary feeding practices; a water and\\nsanitation system that allows for hygienic food\\npreparation and provides safe drinking water as an\\nessential component of a healthy diet; and, a social\\nprotection system that helps poor families afford a\\nvariety of nutritious foods, have access to essential\\nhealth and nutrition services, and adopt positive\\nfeeding, care and hygiene practices.\\nThe section below presents an Action Framework\\nfor each system. While each framework can be\\napplied in isolation, the actions illustrated will\\noften be delivered in conjunction with actions\\nthrough other systems to address the drivers of\\nyoung children’s diets.\\n\\n* The education system does not directly influence the diets of children aged 6–23 months given that these children do not yet attend school/\\npre-school; it is therefore not discussed in this guidance. However, where applicable, some actions indirectly related to the education system have\\nbeen integrated throughout the document.\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 35\\n\\n\\x0c36\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n• Expand the capacity of community platforms to\\nraise consumer demand for nutritious, healthy\\nand safe food;\\n\\n• Assess markets and marketing practices\\nto understand barriers to availability of and\\naccess to affordable, nutritious foods;\\n• Influence national food-based dietary\\nguidelines to reflect the nutrient requirements\\nof young children;\\n• Facilitate application, regulation and enforcement\\nof food safety, nutrition composition and\\nmarketing standards for complementary foods.\\n\\n• Strengthen linkages with other delivery\\nplatforms to deliver skilled counselling.\\n\\n• Strengthen national and decentralized capacity\\nand contact points within agriculture systems to\\nfacilitate the delivery of skilled counselling;\\n\\n• Support formative research on gaps in\\nknowledge, skills, practices, acceptability,\\ndesirability and affordability.\\n\\n• Generate evidence to inform the scale-up of\\nintegrated agriculture, nutrition and livelihoods\\ninterventions targeted at improved access to\\ndiverse and affordable complementary foods.\\n\\n• Advocate with ministries and partners to\\nidentify feasible solutions to strengthen\\nsupply chain efficiency and fortification\\nthrough research and development.\\n\\n• Promote information for parents and caregivers\\non navigating food labels and nutrition\\ninformation for complementary feeding.\\n\\n• Leverage partnerships and generate evidence to\\ninform the scale-up of innovative and communitybased approaches to addressing gaps in food\\npurchasing, use, women’s decision making, and\\nintra-household distribution;\\n\\n• Generate evidence to inform the scale-up of\\ninnovations to improve access to nutritious,\\nsafe and affordable food, with government and\\nlocal small and medium scale enterprises.\\n\\n• Leverage partnerships to support nutrition\\nsensitive agriculture, livelihoods, and postharvest processing to improve access to diverse\\nand affordable foods;\\n\\n• Develop guidelines and monitoring systems\\nto improve policy implementation and\\nsupport the production of and access to\\nnutritious and safe complementary foods;\\n\\nCommunity/Household/Individual\\n\\nM O N I T O R I N G , E VA L UAT I O N & L E A R N I N G\\n\\n(Food securit y situation, humanitarian crisis, political and economic instabilit y, etc.)\\n\\nPROGRAMMING CONTEXT\\n\\n• Strengthen linkages with health and social\\nprotection service delivery, including SBCC.\\n\\n• Align SBCC strategies and communication to\\naddress drivers of caregiver behaviors;\\n\\n• Strengthen policies and plans to influence\\ndemand for nutritious and safe foods and\\nsupport women’s decision-making;\\n\\n• Forge partnerships to address gaps in the policy\\nenvironment and improve access (aligned with\\nthe Code and WHA 69.9).\\n\\n• Strengthen legislation on marketing restrictions,\\nlabeling requirements, taxes, and subsidies for\\nnutritious foods;\\n\\n• Foster policy coordination and partnerships\\nacross sectors to promote access to diverse and\\nnutrient-rich foods;\\n\\n• Influence private sector production, packaging\\nand distribution of convenient, nutritious,\\naffordable and fortified complementary foods.\\n\\n• Support the development of policies on\\nproduction, storage, fortification and biofortification of local and commercial foods;\\n\\n• Advocate with Ministries of Agriculture,\\nTrade, Industry and partners to diversify food\\nproduction with nutrient-rich foods;\\n\\nInstitutional (Public & Private)\\n\\nFigure 6: Delivering actions to improve young children’s diets through the food system\\n\\nAssess critical gaps,\\nbot tlenecks & barriers\\n\\nBEHAVIOURS OF\\nCAREGIVERS\\n\\nFOOD\\nENVIRONMENT\\n\\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nPolicy\\n\\n(in collaboration with the government, UN and other par tners)\\n\\nS T R AT E G I C A C T I O N S\\n\\nDelivering Through the Food System\\n\\nSITUATION ANALYSIS\\n\\nAvailability, access,\\naffordability and\\ndesirability of diets\\nfor young children\\n\\n(6–23 months)\\n\\nImproved access to\\nand consumption\\nof nutritious, safe,\\naffordable and\\nsustainable diets\\nfor young children\\n\\nOUTCOME\\n\\n\\x0c6.2.1 Action Framework for Delivering through\\nthe Food System*\\nThe food system encompasses all elements and\\nactivities related to the production, processing,\\nstorage, distribution, marketing, preparation, and\\nconsumption of food.175, 176 The food system is\\ncomprised of the food supply chain;

This system is\\ncritical to protecting young children’s diets, as poor\\nwater, sanitation and hygiene can expose children to\\npathogens that cause diarrhoea and other infections\\nand can result in environmental enteropathy, leading\\nto impaired structure and function of the small\\nintestine.179 Improved access to basic water and\\nsanitation services can reduce the risk of diarrhoea,180\\nhelminth infections,181 environmental enteric\\ndysfunction (enteropathy)182, and anaemia.\\n\\nCommunity-based platforms and contact points\\nprovide important opportunities to promote\\nrecommended WASH behaviours at community,\\nhousehold and facility level. Strong water and\\nsanitation systems are therefore essential to\\nimproving the availability, quality, affordability and\\nuse of safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation\\nservices for young children.\\nThis section reviews examples of water and\\nsanitation system-related drivers that need to be\\naddressed to improve young children’s diets and\\ncomplements the discussion in section 4.\\nWASH supply and services:\\n• Limited availability of functional toilets, waste\\ntreatment, and other WASH supplies and services;\\n\\n• Poor access to WASH supplies, such as soap for\\nhandwashing;\\n• Constraints in access to clean drinking water\\nsources, especially those within walking distance,\\nwhich influences the time caregivers spend on\\nhousehold activities.\\n\\nStrategic actions to activate the water and\\nsanitation system to improve young children’s diets\\n\\nThe Action Framework illustrates strategic actions\\nthat UNICEF may undertake in collaboration with\\ngovernment and partners at the policy, institutional,\\nand community/household level to address the drivers\\nof children diets through the water and sanitation\\nsystem (Figure 8). The actions proposed in the Action\\nFramework are illustrative rather than exhaustive and\\nshould be adapted to country context.\\nAt policy level, actions to influence the water\\nand sanitation system may include strengthening\\nintegrated WASH, nutrition and health policies;\\nreviewing national SBCC strategies and plans across\\nsectors to ensure that recommended WASH and\\nnutrition behaviours are integrated; and tracking\\nnutrition and WASH indicators in the monitoring\\nsystems of all relevant sectors.\\nAt institutional level, actions to influence\\nthe water and sanitation

Delivering through\\nthe Social Protection System\\nThe social protection system refers to a set of\\npolicies and programmes aimed at protecting all\\npeople against poverty, vulnerability and social\\nexclusion throughout the life course, with emphasis\\non vulnerable groups.183 Nutrition-sensitive social\\nprotection services, coupled with nutrition counselling\\nand education, can improve household food security,\\ndietary diversity and caregiver empowerment.105, 155\\n\\nThe social protection system can increase household\\nresources and reduce the price of food and nutrition\\nservices through social transfers (e.g., food, cash,\\nvouchers), programmes to ensure economic and\\nsocial access to services, social support and care\\nservices, and legislation and policies that prevent\\ndiscrimination in access to services and livelihoods.\\nServices to strengthen women’s empowerment and\\ndecision-making in household spending can also\\nimprove access to nutritious complementary foods.\\nThe social protection system is therefore critical to\\nimproving the availability, quality and affordability of\\nadequate food and services for young children.\\nThis section reviews examples of social\\nprotection-related drivers that need to be\\naddressed to improve young children’s diets and\\ncomplements the discussion in section 4.\\nSocial protection programmes and services:\\n• Poor availability, coverage and effectiveness of\\nsocial protection programmes;\\n\\n• Inadequate targeting of programmes that prevents\\nvulnerable households with young children from\\nreceiving assistance.\\nBehaviours of caregivers:\\n• Lack of time and cultural norms and preferences\\nthat negatively influence food purchasing,\\npreparation and allocation;\\n\\n• Inadequate knowledge on social protection\\nprogrammes and their relation to feeding practices,\\nand limited decision-making power over money\\nand assets.\\n\\nStrategic actions to activate the social protection\\nsystem to improve young children’s diets\\n\\nThe Action Framework illustrates strategic actions\\nthat UNICEF may undertake in collaboration with\\ngovernment and partners at the policy, institutional,\\nand community/household level to address the\\ndrivers of children’s diets through the social\\nprotection system (Figure 9). The actions proposed\\nin the Action Framework are illustrative rather than\\nexhaustive and should be adapted to country context.\\nAt policy level, actions to influence the social\\nprotection system may include strengthening the\\ndesign and targeting of programmes and services;\\nimproving policies, strategies and budgets and\\nfostering coherence among sectors; and ensuring\\nthat social protection programmes and delivery\\nplatforms are supported by adequate national SBCC\\nstrategies.\\nAt institutional level, actions to influence the\\nsocial protection system may include strengthening\\nthe capacity of delivery platforms to deliver\\nintegrated social protection, health, agriculture and\\nnutrition interventions; prioritizing service delivery\\nplatforms and contacts for delivering nutrition\\ncounselling and SBCC aligned with other sectors;\\nintegrating the use of available communication\\nresources (e.g., the ‘first foods’ videos); and\\nstrengthening monitoring systems.\\nAt community/household/individual\\nlevel, actions to influence the social protection\\nsystem may include strengthening the demand for\\nintegrated social protection and nutrition services;\\nfostering women’s decision-making in food\\npurchasing and the feeding of nutritious and safe\\ncomplementary foods; and generating evidence\\nto inform the scale-up of integrated programmes\\ntargeted at addressing gaps in knowledge around\\nfood purchasing, feeding practices and use of\\nresources.\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 43\\n\\n\\x0c7.\\n\\nMonitoring,\\nevaluation and\\nlearning\\n\\n44\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0cThe continuous generation, documentation,\\nsharing and application of knowledge is essential\\nto establishing a robust evidence base for best\\npractices on improving the diets of young children.\\nMonitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) is thus\\ncritical to effective programme implementation and\\nthe achievement of programme objectives. MEL is\\ngenerally driven by questions such as: What is the\\nstate of programme implementation (including pace,\\nprogress against milestones)? Is the programme on\\ntrack to achieve targeted results? What corrective\\nactions, if any, are needed?\\n\\nRecently, the definitions for indicators specific to\\nmeal frequency, dietary diversity and continued\\nbreastfeeding during the complementary feeding\\nperiod were slightly altered.32, 33 ** Additional\\nindicators were also developed to capture nondairy animal-source food consumption, fruit and\\nvegetable consumption, sugar-sweetened beverage\\nconsumption, and unhealthy food consumption.\\nTable 1 provides definitions for new and revised\\nstandard indicators relevant to the complementary\\nfeeding period.\\n\\nThe scope of MEL activities for complementary\\nfeeding programmes should reflect the wide range\\nof determinants and drivers known to impact\\nyoung children’s diets. MEL plans can then shed\\nlight on the factors that may be limiting children’s\\nability to consume nutritious, affordable and safe\\ncomplementary foods, across sectors.\\n7.1 ME ASURING PROGRESS ON\\nIMPROVING YOUNG CHILDREN’S DIETS\\n\\nIn order to facilitate appropriate assessment, targeting,\\nmonitoring and evaluation of IYCF programmes, a set\\nof core IYCF indicators* related to the recommended\\ncomplementary feeding practices were defined and\\npublished by WHO in 2008.184 These indicators were\\nsubsequently adopted as the global standard and\\nintegrated into national household surveys such as\\nDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple\\nIndicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and national nutrition\\nand health surveys, to monitor progress on IYCF\\npractices at national, regional and global levels. These\\nindicators are used in programme-specific evaluations\\nto monitor outcomes or impact.70, 184\\n\\n* These indicators are not the same as the recommendations. For\\nexample, the indicator of minimum dietary diversity should not be\\ninterpreted to mean that only five food groups out of eight (including\\nbreastmilk) are needed for a healthy diet. Infants and young children\\nshould ideally receive food from all food groups daily.\\n\\nThe tracking of these standard indicators is the pillar of\\nMEL at the outcome (or impact) level for programmes\\nto improve young children’s diets. To monitor\\neffectively, governments need to ensure that credible\\nand comprehensive data on complementary feeding\\naligned with these standard global indicators are\\nreported every three to five years. UNICEF maintains\\na global database16 of country-level estimates for all\\nstandard IYCF indicators; however, these indicators\\nare not intended to meet all programme needs for\\nMEL, as they focus on feeding practices and do not\\ncapture information related to access and availability\\nof safe and nutritious foods. Programmes should\\ncomplement these standard indicators with more\\ncontextually-specific process indicators to reflect\\nplanned activities and targets (discussed in more detail\\nlater in this section).\\n7. 2 PROGR AMME MONITORING AND\\nEVALUATION\\n\\nImplementing priority actions involves monitoring\\nprogress and measuring changes in the diets of\\nyoung children at the sub-national and national level\\nusing a set of indicators. Indicators should capture\\nimpact, outcome and output level activities and\\ntargets. To ensure that monitoring and evaluation\\nindicators and activities can effectively compare\\n** Part of the impetus for these revisions was the recognition that the\\noriginal indicators did not adequately capture the quality of children’s\\ndiets.\\n\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 45\\n\\n\\x0cprogramme progress against implementation plans,\\ntheir design should be closely aligned with their\\nprogramme’s theory of change.185 A theory of change\\nfor a programme designed to improve the diets of\\nyoung children should acknowledge the key drivers\\nof complementary feeding and illustrate how actions\\nwithin each of their respective sectors contribute to\\nexpected outputs or outcomes.\\nProgramme specific monitoring and evaluation\\nindicators and activities – linked to priority actions\\nacross drivers – should be included in the national\\nnutrition plan, or clearly defined within relevant\\nnational or sub-national plans. Monitoring and\\nevaluation activities should be multi-year, with\\nactivities planned throughout all stages of the\\nprogramme lifecycle.185 An illustrative results matrix\\n\\nwith generic indicators at all levels is presented in\\nAnnex 6 and can serve as a useful tool which can be\\ncontextualized as appropriate.\\nBoth quantitative and qualitative methods may be\\nemployed to collect identified monitoring indicators.*\\nKey sources of monitoring data at country-level\\ninclude health management information systems\\n(HMIS), logistics/supply management information\\nsystems, and clinic records. These types of internal\\ndata are ideal for programme monitoring given their\\nintegration into existing government systems and\\nroutine collection; however, it can be challenging to\\n* Programme monitoring is defined here as the ongoing process\\nof collecting, analysing, interpreting and reporting indicators to\\ndetermine how well a programme is being executed against planned\\nobjectives. 202\\n\\nTable 1: Revised standard indicators for complementary feeding\\n\\nIndicator\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nContinued breastfeeding\\n\\nPercentage of children aged 12–23 months who were fed with breastmilk during the\\nprevious day\\n\\nIntroduction of solid, semi-solid\\nor soft foods\\n\\nPercentage of infants aged 6–8 months who were fed solid, semi-solid or soft food\\nduring the previous day\\n\\nMinimum dietary diversity\\n\\nPercentage of children aged 6–23 months who received foods from at least five out of\\neight* defined food groups during the previous day\\n\\nMinimum meal frequency\\n\\nPercentage of children aged 6–23 months who received solid, semi-solid, or soft foods\\n(including milk feeds for non-breastfed children) the minimum number of times or more\\nduring the previous day\\n\\nMinimum milk feeding\\nfrequency for non-breastfed\\nchildren\\n\\nProportion of children aged 6–23 months who received at least two milk feeds during the\\nprevious day\\n\\nMinimum acceptable diet\\n\\nPercentage of children aged 6–23 months who received a minimum acceptable diet\\nduring the previous day\\n\\nNon-dairy animal source food\\nconsumption\\n\\nPercentage of children aged 6–23 months who consumed egg and/or flesh foods during\\nthe previous day\\n\\nSugar-sweetened beverage\\nconsumption\\n\\nChildren aged 6–23 months who consumed a sugar-sweetened beverage during the\\nprevious day\\n\\nUnhealthy food consumption\\n\\nPercentage of children aged 6–23 months who consumed selected categories of\\nunhealthy food during the previous day\\n\\nZero vegetable or fruit\\nconsumption\\n\\nPercentage of children aged 6–23 months who did not consume any vegetables or fruits\\nduring the previous day\\n\\n* (1) Breastmilk; (2) grains, roots and tubers; (3) legumes and nuts; (4) dairy products (milk, infant formula, yoghurt, cheese); (5) flesh foods (e.g.,\\nmeat, fish, poultry, organ meats); (6) eggs; (7) vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables, and; (8) other fruits and vegetables.\\n46\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0csuccessfully advocate for the inclusion of new/updated\\nindicators and the quality of indicators is often poor.\\nNonetheless, in many cases, government information\\nsystems are the only source of data available for\\nmonitoring. Strengthening routine monitoring\\nsystems (national and decentralized) to adequately\\ntrack nutrition activities, and more specifically of\\ncomplementary feeding,* is therefore critical.186\\nWhere modification or use of government system\\nindicators is not feasible, external monitoring can be\\nemployed to collect selected indicators.\\nProgramme evaluation may assess: (1) impact (what\\nhappened?); (2) efficiency (what did it cost?); (3)\\ncoverage (who was reached?); (4) process (how did\\nit happen); and, (5) causality (why did it happen?).\\nEvaluation design and objectives should be based on\\nthe programme theory of change, local context and\\navailable resources. Evaluations can be costly and\\ntake time, and countries may not have the resources\\nor capacity to undertake a stand-alone evaluation. In\\nsuch cases, secondary data sources with primary data\\ncollection can be used to fill the data gaps. While not\\nideal, existing national surveys at country level are\\noften used to evaluate programme outcomes. In such\\nscenarios, UNICEF should advocate for the integration\\nof metrics on complementary feeding into national\\nsurveys to inform decisions at country level and better\\ntrack programme implementation at global level.\\nRegardless of methods, the evaluation should provide\\ncredible and useful findings to enable uptake of\\nevidence into programme and policy decision-making\\nprocesses.187\\n\\n7.3 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND\\nLE ARNING\\n\\nThe data generated from monitoring and evaluation\\nactivities should inform programme strategy and\\ndecision-making, identify gaps where further research\\nis required, and be disseminated to facilitate learning\\nacross countries and regions. The generation, use, and\\nreporting of evidence on the drivers of children’s diets\\n(detailed in section 4) is thus a critical part of MEL and\\nshould be strengthened throughout the programme\\nlifecycle.\\nLearning and knowledge management plans\\nshould be included in the design of complementary\\nfeeding programmes. Plans should include evidence\\ngeneration, documentation, knowledge exchange\\nand dissemination, and priorities for research.\\nDocumentation to chronicle programme experiences\\nand lessons learned is particularly critical – and too\\noften underprioritized. Knowledge exchange and\\ndissemination activities should be carefully planned to\\nensure that documentation reaches the right audience,\\nin the right format, at the right time. The estimated\\nlevel of rigour and resources for each knowledge\\nmanagement and learning activity should be planned\\naccordingly to secure the required support for\\nimplementation.\\n\\n* At the time of publishing this Programming Guidance, efforts\\nare under way in selected countries to pilot the integration of ageappropriate complementary feeding indicators in the HMIS.\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 47\\n\\n\\x0c8.\\n\\nApplying the\\nprogramming\\nguidance\\n\\n48\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0cThis UNICEF Programming Guidance aims to improve\\nthe quality of complementary foods and feeding\\npractices by facilitating the scale-up of evidence-based\\nprogrammes using a systems approach. The guidance\\nresponds to the call for evidence on implementing\\nmultisectoral complementary feeding programmes\\nand articulates how country offices can better design,\\nimplement, monitor and evaluate them.\\nThe guidance introduces Action Frameworks as a tool\\nfor facilitating action-oriented programming to improve\\nthe diets of young children aged 6–23 months. It\\nrecognizes that UNICEF country offices are at varied\\nlevels of programming and applying these Action\\nFrameworks will involve prioritizing one or multiple\\ndelivery systems, depending on the country context.\\nThe food system, which has long been neglected,\\nshould be prioritized in most cases, in addition to\\nother relevant systems. To illustrate, if the limited\\navailability of diverse and affordable complementary\\nfoods is a driver of young children’s diets, countries\\nmay prioritize strategic actions for influencing the\\nfood system at policy, institutional and community\\nlevel, while linking actions through social protection\\nprogrammes (to influence food affordability) and\\nhealth systems (to establish the needed regulatory\\nenvironment on food safety and marketing and to\\nstrengthen capacity in healthcare work force).\\nAt country level, the Programming Guidance can\\nbe applied to strengthen the policy environment\\nfor improving young children’s diets by influencing\\nthe national policies, strategies and costed action\\nplans across multiple systems. It can also be applied\\nto strengthen the capacities of relevant systems\\nto deliver quality services and address demandrelated barriers to accessing them at community and\\nhousehold levels. UNICEF country offices should\\nuse a consultative process involving the government\\nand other relevant stakeholders at every stage of\\nprogramming. The Programming Guidance should\\nalso be used to strengthen MEL with the goal of\\ngenerating evidence, documenting results, and\\nimproving accountability at multiple levels and across\\nmultiple systems.\\n\\nWhen adapted at the regional level, the Programming\\nGuidance can support the development of a regional\\nagenda and roadmap for improving young children’s\\ndiets through quality support to countries. The\\nAction Frameworks should be adapted to regional\\ncontext* through a consultative process of engaging\\npartners, including UN agencies, regional economic\\ncommissions, civil society networks, and existing\\ncoordination platforms (such as SUN and regional\\nnutrition working groups).\\nApplying the Programming Guidance at country and\\nregional levels could include:\\n• Influencing governments and partners to prioritize\\nand invest in improving the diets of young children\\nthrough strengthening national nutrition action plans\\nand strategies;\\n• Strengthening coordination and partnerships\\nto address multiple barriers and bottlenecks to\\nimproving young children’s diets;\\n• Forging partnerships with the Ministry of\\nAgriculture, Trade, Industry, and others to\\nstrengthen food systems and make nutritious diets\\navailable and affordable;\\n• Building synergies within the health system to\\noptimize opportunities for linking health, nutrition\\nand WASH services to improve the quality of young\\nchildren’s diets;\\n• Influencing national social protection programmes\\nto be more nutrition-sensitive and designed and\\ntargeted to improve young children’s diets;\\n• Strengthening coherence and synergy in the\\npolicies, budgets and services designed to improve\\nnutrition outcomes for young children.\\nThese actions have the power to catalyse progress\\nat national, regional and global levels to prevent all\\nforms of malnutrition by promoting adequate foods,\\nadequate services and adequate practices and\\ntherefore, ensure a brighter future for children and\\ntheir families.\\n\\n* At the time of publishing this Programming Guidance, the Action Framework has already been adapted to regional context in four of the seven\\nUNICEF regions.\\nImproving Young Children’s Diets during the Complementary Feeding Period\\u2003\\u2002 49\\n\\n\\x0cEndnotes\\n1.

4: Assessing availability, promotion and perception of\\ncommercially produced complementary foods, snacks and\\nbeverages\\nIt is well established that food product promotion can negatively influence the diets of infants and young children.46-48 The\\nCode and the WHO Guidance on Ending the Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young Children regulate\\nthe advertising and promotion of breastmilk substitutes (BMS) and commercially produced complementary food (CPCF).\\nHowever, there is often little evidence in-country on the types of CPCF and commercial snack and beverage products\\navailable in retail locations, the extent to which these products are explicitly promoted to caregivers of young children, and\\nhow these products are used and perceived by caregivers.\\nAssessing the availability, promotion and perception of CPCF, snacks, and beverages is a critical component of a situation\\nanalysis on the drivers of young children’s diets. Key areas that warrant investigation, and methods that have been tested\\nfor their exploration, are summarized below:\\n\\n1. Availability of and promotional practices for CPCF\\nand commercial snack and beverage products in\\nretail locations (point-of-sale)\\n\\n2. Caregiver perceptions and factors influencing the\\nuse and feeding of CPCF and commercial snacks and\\nbeverages\\n\\nAssessing the extent to which these products are available\\nand promoted in retail locations can help to estimate the\\nlikelihood of children’s exposure (directly and indirectly)\\nto marketing of nutrient-poor snack foods and beverages.\\nFurther, understanding the extent of marketing in these\\nretail locations is necessary for the development and\\nstrengthening of national regulations on inappropriate\\npromotion of foods.49 Illustrative research questions are\\nlisted below, which could be further explored based on\\ncontext.\\n\\nUnderstanding the drivers behind caregiver decisions to\\npurchase and use these products can help identify ways to\\ncurb consumption rates.50 Illustrative research questions\\nare listed below, which could be further explored based on\\ncontext.\\n\\nResearch questions:\\n• Types of CPCF and commercial snack and beverage\\nproducts available in retail locations.\\n• Target age groups of products promoted.\\n• Scale and type of promotional activities used to market\\nCPCF and commercial snack and beverage products to\\ncaregivers and young children.\\n• Nutrient profiles of the CPCF and commercial snack and\\nbeverage products sold.\\n• Retailers’ interest in actively promoting healthy foods.\\n\\nMethods:\\n• Scan of retail locations and market profiling. This\\nincludes the sampling of different retail locations (from\\nsmall, informal shops to large grocery stores) and\\ncollecting data in these locations on product availability,\\ntype and quality. Further, promotional activities within\\nretail locations can be observed, categorized and\\nrecorded during data collection.49\\n• Structured or semi-structured interviews may also be\\nconducted with retailers and consumers on promotional\\nactivities.\\n\\nResearch questions:\\n\\n• Profile of caregivers’ use of CPCF and commercial\\nsnack and beverage products for feeding children.\\n• Rationale for providing CPCF and commercial snack and\\nbeverage products to children.\\n• Caregiver opinions on quality and utility of different\\ntypes of CPCF and commercial snack and beverage\\nproducts.\\n• Factors that influence purchasing CPCF and commercial\\nsnack and beverage products.\\n• Factors that influence feeding CPCF and commercial\\nsnack and beverage products to children.\\n\\nMethods:\\n\\n• A mixed-methods approach can be employed, utilizing\\nboth qualitative and quantitative methods.\\n• Focus group discussions and participatory exercises\\nwith caregivers (non-working mothers, working\\nmothers, and grandmothers or other family caregivers).\\n• In-depth interviews with key informants.\\n• Cross-sectional survey of caregivers with infants and\\nyoung children.50\\n\\nFurther information and examples of relevant research topics and methods to assess the availability, promotion and\\nperception of CPCF, snacks and beverages can be found in various Assessment and Research on Child Feeding (ARCH)\\npublications (see: https://archnutrition.org/resources/ ).\\n\\n66\\u2003\\u2002 UNICEF Programming Guidance\\n\\n\\x0cAnnex 5: Resources, tools and useful links related to\\nimproving young children’s diets\\nCapacity building\\n\\nFirst Foods for Young Children: A video series on\\ncomplementary feeding (2018) https://www.unicef.org/\\nnutrition/102823_The%20video%20series.html\\n\\nGuidance on ending the inappropriate promotion of foods\\nfor infants and young children: Implementation manual.\\nWHO (2017). https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/hand\\nle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1\\n\\nProgramming for infant and young child feeding: UNICEFCornell online course (Transitioned from Cornell to Agora in\\n2019) https://agora.unicef.org/course/info.php?id=16009\\n\\nEssential Nutrition Actions: mainstreaming nutrition\\nthrough the life-course.
